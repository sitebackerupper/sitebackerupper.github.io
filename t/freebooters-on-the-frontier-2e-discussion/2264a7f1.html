          <p>I really like the idea of player principles. I first saw them‚Äîalong with ‚Äúagenda‚Äù, ‚Äúwhen in doubt‚Äù, ‚Äútriggering moves‚Äù, and ‚Äúhold and spend‚Äù‚Äîin <a href="https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/homebrew-world.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Homebrew World‚Äôs</a> Player‚Äôs Guide, included with every playbook. Player facing materials generally tend to be a mix of flavor and mechanics, but rarely do they touch on the bigger picture conceptual stuff in a tidy way. I think Jeremy‚Äôs Player‚Äôs Guide is a great addition to the playbooks.</p>

          <p>Yeah, my players are very aware that it is their XP on the line.  They are advancing at a pretty good pace already, so I think it‚Äôs less of an issue for them.  They always get Trait XP, which I think is more their focus.</p>
<p>My favorite moments as Judge in the campaign so far (they are hitting 3rd level right now and have made two (mostly) successful expeditions into the wilds) have been when they come up with crazy, creative solutions to problems.</p>
<p>In the first dungeon, they had encountered a pit trap, then found the control panel for it, so they reset the trap.  They encountered some flaming animated suits of armor, and half the party lured them over the pit while the other half ran to the controls and opened it, dropping the flaming armor into the pit.</p>
<p>While traveling they ran across the tracks of a herd of musk oxen, and decided to try and use the merman‚Äôs pet cow (don‚Äôt ask) Lilith to lure one of the Musk Oxen away from the heard and capture it for use as a beast of burden.  One roll of 2 later, and they were scattered across the snowy landscape, fleeing the stampeding herd.</p>
<p>In the last dungeon, they encountered a cursed trap door that turned them either partially or completely into seals as they went through.  Going back through the trap the other way turned them back into their normal selves, but this was complicated by the monsters they had fled on the other side of the trap.  Watching their attempts to run around the dungeon (as seals) and go back and forth through the seal transformation trap was very entertaining.</p>
<p>They‚Äôve done some creative problem solving while on the trail as well, dealing with a blizzard, a cracked runner on their sledge, a hireling that they pushed too far who stole some supplies and fled, run-ins with snow spirits, etc.</p>
<p>During down time in town this week, the Narwhal-man cleric of the god of Lust used his cut of the treasure to buy a hovel, set up a long term contract with a sex worker, and establish a mini-‚Äútemple‚Äù.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs becoming something of a theme of the campaign for them to use the dead bodies of fallen hirelings and/or PCs (we‚Äôve had two PC deaths so far, both characters of the same player‚Ä¶) as distractions for creature encounters.</p>
<p>The wide open, sandbox nature of a Freebooters campaign leads to so many great scenes and moments, that I know we wouldn‚Äôt have in a more structured, plot driven game.</p>

          <p>Hey everyone! Here‚Äôs the recap of the first session of the month-long FotF 2E campaign I‚Äôm running at Pandemonium. Five players joined the table, and we were scheduled for four hours. None of them had played the game before, but a few mentioned that they had played Blades in the Dark.<br>
We didn‚Äôt do a rules opener, just opened the game with the presentation of <em>‚Äúhere you be in the frontier lands‚Ä¶‚Äù</em> as I presented a map that was prepared in advance. A few places were marked, but it was mostly blank. The region on the map is known to locals as the Saltlands, named this way because the sea to the north and the earth below are very saline in mineral composition. The climate is frigid, but it‚Äôs hard for ice and snow to consistently form on the terrain because the soil is so saline, so it ends up being wet and miserable most of the time. The only ‚Äúknown‚Äù settlement in the region is the small shipping town Fritenbil, the site of the freebooters‚Äô arrival from the southern highway. I rolled neutral for the settlement, and features include ‚Äúdefensible‚Äù and ‚Äúidiosyncratic clothing/local craft‚Äù‚Äîfrom that I determined that even the inns and taverns in Fritenbil are built on tall solid stone supports, and that the locals adorn wide-brim hats and shoulder pads with the large fuzzy feathers of giant sea birds found farther north along the coastline.<br>
The players rolled their characters pretty much from the get-go after determining any content we‚Äôd like X‚Äôed or kept off-screen (using ‚ÄúLines &amp; Veils‚Äù by Ron Edwards). They rolled dwarf cleric, human thief, halfling thief, halfling fighter, and human magic-user (the mage visibly <em>loved</em> the spell-generator, and used the wizard‚Äôs name from the second generated spell as his own). We then jumped into some discussion as far as how the heritages are organized and presented in this world. A highlight of that was that, in our world, elves, and much unlike the Tolkien archetype of ‚Äò6‚Äô5‚Äù skinny, white blonde model‚Äô, are almost insect-like in appearance, shorter than humans on average, with large, beady eyes and localized flora along their bodies.<br>
It was really fun to see the players buy into the ‚Äúthis place is miserable‚Äù trope depicted through the NPCs. Speaking of NPCs, here are some highlights (generated through the ‚ÄúSettlements &amp; Citizens‚Äù supplement): Bimbo Fidlestics, the neutral human merchant motivated by luck who trades in unusual wares and is regarded as a drunkard and provocateur; Tulic Corelli, the evil halfling baker motivated by greed who has oily hair, wears flashy clothing and is allergic to bees (and who also vaguely resembles The Penguin); Firian Leit, the evil human actor who is competitive and challenging but also sensitive and empathetic, so a real piece of work that one.<br>
From there it was all improv, with my notes informing me of where the full cast of NPCs might hang out at any given time in this sad, cold town. Our first scene saw the players crowded in the town square (where the marketplace is set up). From there they watched the evil actor Firian perform a monologue for the townspeople (who don‚Äôt really like him), and the thieves took advantage of the spectacle to do some purloin. They were almost caught, too. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
The players split up after that, which was fun! We jumped from scene to scene exploring the town, as the players interacted with NPCs and took notes of rumors and superstitions. The human thief in our party had the vice ‚Äúprejudiced‚Äù, and that came up when she verbally harassed an elf at a tavern bar. It was dramatic, as everyone at the table audibly ‚ÄúOooooo‚Äôd‚Äù (the thief sure as heck got their trait XP during wrap up).<br>
In our last hour the players formed one group after being contracted by a halfling in the guildhall to find the deed to the abandoned keep southeast of Fritenbil. We used a custom move for traveling that asks for a Scout, Navigator, and Rear-guard, and the player at the rear noticed that the party was being followed by a band of armed halflings. We ended the session on that encounter.<br>
Gotta say it again, this game is a blast <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
We had a lot of laughs with the character building, and the interactions with the NPCs were very engaging and seemed to generate all the plot lines we could ever need.<br>
Looking forward to future updates (and please let me know if you have any tips on keeping these recaps more concise).</p>

          <p>Thank for this, <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/duffina">@duffina</a>! I don‚Äôt think your account needs to be any more concise, but maybe that‚Äôs just me.</p>
<p>Love the insectoid elves.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm curious about your prep for this session. Am I understanding correctly that your basic prep was to generate the settlement and three NPCs? Did you choose to set the first scene in the crowded marketplace in part because you saw an opportunity to integrate the NPC actor, or did the PCs choose to start there? Did they encounter the merchant and/or baker, or were those folks just waiting in the wings for the right opportunity? How did you come up with other NPCs that made an appearance? Pure improv, or was there any on-the-fly rolling involved? Did you prep the mission from the guildhall, or come up with that on the spot?</p>

          <p>My overall prep included the settlement and its districts, and keying NPCs to districts based on their professions. So the baker was sort of keyed to the eastern district where some of the wealthier denizens live and also to southern warehouse district in the evening as a sort of a ringleader and player in the underbellies of the shipping industry. The actor was keyed to taverns throughout town and to the marketplace/town square in the afternoons when it‚Äôd be busy.<br>
The first scene came about naturally. The players dived into the marketplace in the Basic Rules as soon as they were done generating characters. Since they were buying things, I made the move to visualize the process and situate them in the marketplace proper, and just as the actor began his performance. This also gave me the opportunity to introduce a few standouts among the crowd (3 of my other NPCs who are keyed to frequent town square).<br>
The baker was indeed encountered later in the evening as one of the players branched off from the rest of the group. The player passed an alleyway where the baker and his posse could be seen roughing up a dwarven worker, and chose to ignore it. The baker responded with a villainous laugh and an audible ‚Äúain‚Äôt nobody in this town to save you now‚Äù (introducing one of the town‚Äôs problems, namely that it‚Äôs unruly and lawless).<br>
All in all I prepared 20 NPCs, but it honestly only took me an hour and a half because of how streamlined the process is in your supplement. I just didn‚Äôt need to write descriptions or script anything beyond giving them tags/color and keying them to parts of town. It‚Äôs also for this reason that I didn‚Äôt need to roll them up on the spot.<br>
My other prep was to include specific buildings in town (inns and taverns, a few shops, the guildhall, etc.). All the inns/taverns were made using the random generators on donjon, which I‚Äôve found work excellently with this game. I mean, within 5 minutes I had the locations of the inns/taverns (near the market district, etc.), menu items, rumors, and all the tavern-goers (even more NPCs!). The other buildings were keyed to districts and tasks; I knew beforehand that the contractors in the guildhall were looking to acquire the deed to an abandoned keep, and that they‚Äôd be desperate enough to hire a bunch of wierdo freebooters to do it for them.<br>
EDIT: I have no idea what‚Äôs in this keep and will do some Paint the Scene with players next session, specifically to determine who or what currently inhabits it‚Ä¶<br>
So far the only on the fly rolls I made were to determine pickpocket loot and stolen goods (using the village items chart in your Funnel supplement, rerolling when necessary).</p>
