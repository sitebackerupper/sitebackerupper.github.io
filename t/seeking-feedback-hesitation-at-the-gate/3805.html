          <p><strong>Hesitation at the Gate</strong>, is an RPG where you play as seekers of Truth in a mystic order during the late Renaissance period. Conflicts are resolved using a trick-taking system with Tarot cards. Characters are built with goals, character affects, skills, personal/interpersonal bonds, and the art/technology they create. The game has themes of alchemy, hermeticism, the Enlightenment, and occultism but is setting pliable to allow players to tweak things to their liking.</p>
<p>I would very much appreciate any feedback people are willing to give. I have done a few playtests with my personal playgroup and we did not experience any logistical issues like lack of cards or excessive downtime at 2-3 players + GM, but they also had the benefit of the game creator explaining the game as we played it. I am aware that there are missing gameplay examples and summarizing charts, I hope things are not too unintelligible. Some specific feedback/suggestions I am looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are any of the rules just completely baffling?</li>
<li>Are there any clear holes/blind spots in the rules?</li>
<li>It has come out in play that there feels like diminishing returns in skills/bonds for ranks 3+, are there any attractive bonuses that could shore up this issue?</li>
</ul>

          <p>Theme is completely up my alley so I jumped on it as soon as I had some time. I’m half way through and so far the feedback I can provide is very high level.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Twenty pages in and I still don’t know if this game is for me. It’s hard for me to get an idea of intended atmosphere of the game and part of that stems from unopinionated take on various mechanical elements. Monies can be tracked but don’t have to. What characters and orders have access to is up to people playing which is weird considering that vices are of vital importance here and many of the vices we know revolve around spending money. This is in stark contrast to the detailed description of types (sources) of magic, classes of magical creatures, etc. which I still don’t understand the in-game significance of (again, perhaps it’s detailed further down the document).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would very much appreciate rules starting with a high level overview of the gameplay providing info on how mechanics and interaction between participants pan out. It doesn’t have to be AP and could reuse the table image from the gameplay section. Something like: <em>“Players control actions of characters dreaming of greatness. These characters are skilled in various arts and players will take turns describing how their characters try to achieve their goals. GM and other players may help with or impede these attempts in accordance to relationships characters have created with themselves and the world through their actions or personal flaws. All this will lead to conflicts which are resolved using tarot cards blindly bid by participants during conflict resolution”</em>. I’m not the most colorful writer, I know. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Basically what I personally need is a brief explanation of what happens during the game, why and what sort of story does it create. I’m not the best person to describe that though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This also reminds me that I’m still not sure if this is supposed to be XVIIc. with functional magic or sort-of-but-not-really reality. In particular: does King James bible exist? When we’re talking about divine books and what not, is this the stuff we know or some made up religious texts? I suspect it may be explained later in the document but I feel it’s important to get an idea of what this game is about early.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the reading there seems to be no sense of urgency. How acts end is up to table agreement which is probably why acts are advertised to take between 45 and 120 minutes (IIRC). This too seems to contrast with other parts of the system, namely the fact that people may grow old and die pursuing their ultimate goal without reaching it. Urgency was something I thought would make a bulk of drama until I got to the “Playing the Game” section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How headings are indicated is at times confusing. For instance it looks like personal bonds could very well be of antagonistic type so having antagonistic bonds as a separate section made understanding the whole thing hard. Misc bonds also seem redundant given that examples provided could easily fall into relationship or debt category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminology is confusing. Some things seem fairly intuitive, others - like trick - are impossible for me to grok. Most of the glossary would be better presented with some visual aid (even with the aforementioned table illustration). I don’t see anywhere mentioned whether ranks are open ended or there’s a 3- (or whatever-) step scale.</p>
</li>
</ol>

          <p>thank you very much for taking the time to slog through it. If you don’t mind, I have some clarifications and will try to summarize what I am getting from your feedback</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The setting is very much “Renaissance” without much further dictation. By the way the arts (skills) and cosmology is laid out, magic is very much real. The intent is, without player injected factors, to essentially be the 17th century but assume everything about alchemy, magic, demons, angels, etc. is completely real. I do not have a preference for games with highly codified settings so I wanted this to push players in the direction of a time period and themes as oppose to directing the narrative or providing a bunch of proper nouns. I realize there is not much “flavor” text but I think art would also serve this purpose quite well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have spent most of my time trying to refine and focus the rules, and I now realize the rules as a text are sorely lacking in organization. I would very much like to hear if your impression of the rules has changed after finishing the full text, but stuff definitely needs to be shifted around to explain better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry about the terminology! “Trick” is taken from trick-taking card games. I will review the explanation but so far it’s been hard to explain the concept without feeling like I’m going off on a gigantic tangent from the rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I could summarize the gist of what I’m getting from your feedback, the game is missing a <strong>clear hook</strong> and <strong>concise summary</strong>? I’ve been focusing my writing on the rules as rules, it definitely needs better framing and more guiding hand of the author to point people in the right direction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>again thank you!</p>

          <p>Thanks for clarifications. I read the document through and re-read parts of it.</p>
<p>I don’t think that flavor text is needed in the way, say, World of Darkness had tons of low quality prose that was supposed to be moody. But what I’d like to see is pretty much what you’ve laid out above early in document. “The intent is (…) to essentially be the 17th century but assume everything about alchemy, magic, demons, angels, etc. is completely real” gave me half of what I needed to get a feel of the game. This is much stronger than what you have there at the moment given that the time period blurb is in the City section where you run through a bunch of questions participants should answer. I read that and became confused: how much of this is optional? Is it how 17th century really was, what you wanted to infuse into a quasi-17th century setting? It probably boils down to what you assume to be obvious (whether it relates to the game of real world history) and what I as a reader know.</p>
<p>What I guess I’m trying to say is that my preference for source material is to have very general description of everything expanded outwards further down the text.  And yes, hook and summary are what I’d start with. You sort of do have most of the general stuff but it’s scattered around a bit. I’ll spend some time trying to provide more detailed examples. I don’t have a clear idea what should go where yet, mostly because I don’t fully grok how the game works just yet (even though I read it all). I’ll try and post some questions tomorrow.</p>

          <p>Some basic questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do participants (or fortune) contribute to the trick with at most one card or is it possible to add extra cards to the trick?</li>
<li>Wouldn’t the initiating player be the one who declares that there’s a conflict and decides on a goal (or discusses goal with other players)?</li>
<li>Trick is assembled face down, then cards are revealed. If major arcana are in play and major arcana have pretty fluid mechanic behind them, how do you resolve the conflict for/against players when two major arcanas are played? The example from “The Arcana” section (Once a player has played an arcana card…) reads as if players had mutual understanding of what cards they play. Is it assumed that major and minor arcana have different backs? But even then you don’t know what is on the major arcana face.</li>
<li>Can players openly discuss what cards they are going to play?</li>
<li>If great works are what characters create, should “I want a +1 damage doohickey” be on the list of character’s personal goals? Or do you see them more as something that characters pursue once they figure out what they need to increase the chance of success on the path to their major goal?</li>
</ol>
<p>To expand on 2 above, I’ve got this broader problem understanding the flow of the game. People sit by the table and then what? Does the GM set up a scene that enables players to work towards their goals or is it up to the players to initiate something? Let’s say the latter, John is more proactive so he declares to pursue one of his minor goals, say, find an obscure info about a demon in a library. But this is likely in the forbidden section and head of the order rarely permits people to go there so this leads to social conflict between him and he higher up. Other characters can join him, e.g. group can concoct a fake story they will use in an argument. But the initiating player is likely going to be the one towards the goal of whom the scene is contributing, no?</p>
<p>Some other general comments:<br>
a. I like how resources (arts and bond ranks, IP, cards) are handled in game. I’m not sure if it’s perfectly balanced but it seems like a solid base for the game.<br>
b. I’d much rather see major arcana domains to be limited to a single noun. I can’t tell if this was the process but whenever I’m designing things I fall into a symmetry trap. There’s a lot of threes in this game so if I were you I’d be tempted to have 3 domains per arcana. But, as you point out in the text, this leads to conflicts of influence these domains have. This doesn’t strike me as particularly fun thing to resolve during the game.<br>
c. GM holds a hand of fate so why not call him accordingly? (fate master, ref of the fate or something like that)<br>
d. “What you need” has subsection “Players” which includes info on players and GM. I’d probably call it “Participants” so the term player is unambiguous.<br>
e. I’d love to see a single place where everything about IP is assembled (how you can get it, how you spend it and so on).</p>

<p>Correct, one card possible. There used to be rules for playing more than one card but it gummed up the clarity of conflict resolution so I scrapped it, some of the references might still be lurking in the text though…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correct. The game is very player driven. As the GM I have mostly been playing a reactive game, filling in details when they need to change locations, responding to their actions, etc. I have also initiated a few conflicts against players in situations where they goaded NPCs to lashing out at them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe it’s specified that two arcana cannot be used for the same action, but they can definitely counter/complement each other. Those rules might not have the proximity to each other that aids understanding though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sure thing! But any info you put in public is info the GM hears as well. You could theoretically make some kind of code to hide from the GM but when you draw 2+ cards every conflict, plans change quite frequently. In play so far having a hand of cards gives you a guide for what kind of conflicts you have confidence in beating but with the advantage mechanic you get a lot more ability to adapt and risk for better plays than it feels like from the rules alone. Not sure how I can communicate that in the text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can definitely go for something like that! One of my players is playing a mechanic with the ultimate goal of “create a world free of manual labor with an automaton utopia”, his current minor goal is to create an automated brewery.<br>
“Works” exist both as necessitated by the flavor (You’re going to want to make spells, inventions, art, etc.) and as a way to interact with the card mechanics since arts and bonds are mostly a narrative interaction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the flow of the game, I have tried it both ways, one in which I set up a scenario for the players to interact with and just letting them loose to pursue their goals. The scenario based design did not flow particularly well, there was a lot of “stuttering” for lack of a better word as the players felt like they had to guess what conflict I had laid out in their way. Letting the players just run wild has created a much more enjoyable experience; as a GM I had much less wasted prep material and the emerging narrative felt more natural. There is the issue that 1 of my players is not super proactive, they basically got left behind in the lab while the other 2 went out gallivanting.<br>
One weakness I’m seeing in the game is that if players do not create at least moderately complimentary goals, it can create tension as people feel like their hogging the spotlight by chasing their own personal goals and expecting others to tag along. On the other hand it also means you have X plot threads to tug on (where X is the number of players) if gameplay every lulls.</p>
<p>last comments:<br>
b. I pulled the arcana domains directly from the handbook that comes with the Rider-Waite deck. The handbook requires a little…interpretation… but I can see how there is too much info provided for such an open ended mechanic.<br>
c. love it<br>
d. I try to always stress that the GM is a player too, but I see your point.<br>
e. yeah that’s very much necessary. I think having some sample characters would also help immensely in how someone is supposed to grok the style of game</p>
<p>Almost forgot, thank you for doing such a thorough interrogation of the text!</p>
