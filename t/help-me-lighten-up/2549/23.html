          <p>My advice would be to stop being the boss. Play some GMless, GMful, heavily collaborative games. Ask your friends to step up and run some games that you get to play. Cede your authority and embrace the group vibe while adding your own special darkness now and again.</p>

          <p>So the darkness arises from the complications, not the game’s genre? That seems like it would be hard to change. I like dark fiction; I get bored with novels where “everything is beautiful and nothing hurt.” It’s not that I don’t get satisfaction from other texts or that darkness is the only good mode, it’s just less emotionally impactful. I empathize here.</p>
<p>Maybe use that old DW complication roll table (or make your own) that has more moderate responses to the game. This way it’s not taking you extra time in-game and has some moderation built in. Or make a simple table with increasing intensity of consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>broken finger &gt; mutated hand &gt; dismembered forearm.</li>
<li>hear a voice in your head &gt; sickening feeling like there’s something inside you &gt; your actions are no longer your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think “Trophy” does with “Conditions” growing in intensity as you encounter new rings, you might take a look at that.</p>

          <p>The advice here has been spot on. My advice is pretty similar to what others said (<a class="mention" href="../../../../external.html?link=https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/blakeryan">@BlakeRyan</a> and <a class="mention" href="../../../../external.html?link=https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jimlikesgames">@JimLikesGames</a> in particular) but maybe this formulation will also be useful.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to make a list of ideas of scenes, twists, or story lines which you would consider <em>dramatic</em>, <em>exciting</em>, or <em>fun</em> (and in any case not <em>dark</em>). Don’t railroad people towards these, but just figure out for yourself what they look like and how you might get there from your story using the MC moves.</p>
<p>These can be large story arcs, complications from their alter ego, twists to their relationships (marriage, break up, problems at work, moving, etc.), teaming up with villains to do something non-villainous, visiting a new city, etc. They can also just be small scenes you think would be fun to try, e.g. superheroes at a party or a bar, what it’s like having to testify in court, being interviewed by the Super Society, etc. The important thing is that they seem interesting to you and that you can get used to seeing their <em>shape</em> and <em>feel</em>.</p>
<p>Going <em>dark</em> in a story is a little bit like eating sugar or a dessert in a meal. Characters often have tragic pasts, or experience loss, but these events are more significant and satisfying when they occur after other character and plot development (the nutritious meal). But once you get used to eating a lot of sweets all the time it’s hard to appreciate the other flavors and break the habit.</p>
<p>Since you’ve trained yourself to see ways to take stories in a dark direction this will likely be your impulse while running the game. To break the habit, you not only need to reign in this impulse (which it sounds like you’re doing) but also build a sense of where you <em>do</em> want to go, and practice seeing opportunities to get there.</p>

          <p>It sounds like you’ve become a pro at making your stakes matter by making them dark. (Not  a bad thing - I think a lot of people struggle with that!)</p>
<p>Since your goal is to make things feel lighter, rather than going for the grimmest stakes available, instead look for stakes that matter to the PCs <em>personally</em> but aren’t going to cause death, dismemberment, or insanity. That way you have investment and tension (which often is what amounts to “fun”) without the consequences having to be “And also your beloved companion is brutally removed from existence in front of you.”</p>
<p>Good news is, in Masks, this is especially easy since you’re playing teenagers who care about ALL SORTS OF THINGS that might not lead to grim ends. Prom night? Likes on Instagram? Attaining your dreams of getting accepted into your ideal college RIGHT NOW? That new pair of shoes or iPhone upgrade? All things that can cause the character to care, to chase things, and don’t have to go dark if they lose them or if you want to ramp things up a bit.</p>
<p>Look for character-invested stakes that <em>feel</em> like they life-or-death matter without <em>actually</em> life-or-death mattering.</p>

          <p>Have you ever heard of Swords Without Master or Monkeydome?</p>
<p>Those games introduce “tone” as a variable, and some technique for switching it over.</p>
<p>You could make a “tone” tool for yourself, and engage it at certain times. For example, a card which says “Grim” on one side, and “Full of Hope” on the other. The rule is that you can’t flip over the card until you create or narrate something that fills that quality, and you can’t go against the quality while it’s face up, either. See if that kind of thing makes a change to your GMing; everything is worth a try!</p>

<p>I’ve got Swords Without Master haven’t gotten a chance to really read it yet. But it sounds like the kind of concrete tool I can apply at the table that will remind me and allow my players to help correct course if I go against the card, because they’ll know the state of the tone card.</p>

          <p>Very nice! I don’t think reading that game will give you much more in terms of tone; the only difference is that in the game, the tone switches based on a die roll.</p>
<p>It’s definitely worth finding some cues for yourself like these, whether it’s for prep or for play. You could also have a checklist of more specific things, like, “A kind and well-meaning soul”, which you check off when you include them in your prep or in a scene. “Someone develops a crush without ulterior motives,” stuff like that. It depends a fair deal on the specifics of your game and the particulars of how you tend to “get dark”.</p>
<p>Can you think of any instances of your game where you <em>tried</em> to make things less grim, but you feel the attempt didn’t work (either because you couldn’t follow through, or because you didn’t do it the way you had wished)?</p>

          <p>A thing I did for a while last year was play a series of characters really <em>sincerely</em>. That is, they were what they said they were; it wasn’t that they lacked substance, but their substances wasn’t particularly obfuscated. I found that really helped me get into the space of all kinds of different characters, good and bad. That might be a thing to try; if you have good characters, make them <em>good</em>, not good by convenience but for reasons, reasons that are hard to corrupt. And if you have evil characters…well, they should have reasons too <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>There was a thing I noticed back when my meetup did Night Witches. We did the entire run of the game, from training to the end of the war. One of the GMs was pretty cognizant of how terrible the Soviet system was and so we lived in a crapsack world of constant pain from outside. Now, this can be fine: the queer reading of NW is about building your own community in the face of an outside world. But I had been reading “A Dance With Death,” a book of interviews with the actual Night Witches and what stood out to me was that they were a phenomenally high-morale unit: they did a grind any pilot would find overwhelming and did it night after night. So when I rotated into the GMs chair, I made a couple of characters that weren’t so…dark. The new Chief of Staff was an officer of the “my job is to keep you alive and flying” persuasion who was on the characters’ side as much as possible. And the new politruk was…an inexperienced woman who’d have been a better Komsomol camp counselor than hardcore commissar. She really believed in socialism and education. (I modeled her off the political officer interviewed in “A Dance With Death.”) I think having those two around helped; certainly at the end of my run, the PCs organized an off-the-books raid on a German prisoner train with the help of some sexy partisans to rescue the captain <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Glimmers of light and hope are why we can stand in the grimdarkness, I suppose.</p>

          <p>Someone who worked for me, and was worried he always managed people a little too roughly, had a block of wood made with a variety of leadership styles on each of 8 faces: confrontational to collaborative.  After every interaction with someone he managed he’d rotate the block as a reminder to respond differently to the next one.  I hadn’t thought about applying this on an RPG context until I read this thread.</p>

    I’ll add some more commentary here, and mention that comments, questions, and so forth are very welcome! 
… 
I found it very difficult to play the Master: always walking a line between portraying the villain and running the game in a fair and generous way. This game, like  Dog Eat Dog , blurs the line a little between the character and the player, and given the amount of power the Master has over the Minions, could easily become a pretty twisted power fantasy. I found it hard to be appropriately…
  </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>As you can see, I struggled with the incredibly dark and heavy-handed portrayal of the Master the game demanded of me. While it was occasionally exciting to consider twisted, diabolical plans, it was also emotionally wearying. So I found tremendous relief in the “overture” or “Connection” scenes. I made the Connections (human locals that are dear to the Minions) sympathetic, kind, innocent, and I played the scenes with them in warm tones and in a gentle key.</p>
<p>I also combined this with greater freedom for the players to contribute to the narrative. When the Master was involved, I framed hard and controlled the narrative. In Connection scenes, the players had freedom to frame the scene themselves and I tended to ‘say yes’ to whatever they offered.</p>
<p>Putting all that together, it was great to find relief from the heavy, dark, sadistic Master scenes in more warm-hearted and gentle Connection scenes, and a big part of that was the way I chose to play those characters. That balance between the dark and the warm really made the game work for me.</p>
<p>I hope that might be a source of inspiration for you, Jason! Perhaps it will spark a thought or an idea.</p>

          <h1>Followup: Results</h1>
<p>Hey everyone, thank you so much for your help - I just wanted to post a quick followup about what I tried and how it went.</p>
<p>I tried three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I prepped light. Making a planet for their first proper session of Apocalypse Sonata I chose a confusing planet, and made it deliberately lighthearted.</li>
<li>I opened the game telling them I’d been thinking about this and asking for their help recognizing when things had gone too dark. I didn’t want to get as formal as an X-Card because this was explicitly not about not having to talk about what was edited out - it was about giving me feedback and that requires talking. So I asked them to just make a “time out” sign if anything was too much.</li>
<li>I put an index card on the table and wrote “DARK” on one side in black sharpie. I said, “When I go to the dark side, we’ll flip this card so the DARK shows. I can’t go dark again until we’ve flipped it over by doing something lighter, OK?”</li>
</ol>
<p>It went really well. The players expressed their gratitude that I was trying to change things and we ended up only flipping the dark side card for something a <strong>player</strong> contributed. We didn’t want to edit it out, we just wanted to vary the dynamic. Nobody called a time out on me and I felt like this was a change I could make <strong>without</strong> ruining my game for a year as with my transition to more narrative and player-facing play.</p>

          <p><a class="mention" href="../../../../external.html?link=https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/curubethion">@Curubethion</a> - yeah, the standout for me was when the players realized that the amorphous, amoeba-like aliens thought that they (The PCs) were inferior life forms (kind of disgusting, but also kind of cute - like the way I feel about snakes) because they were a solid, unchanging shape. Then the shapeshifter in the group shifted into an amoebic shape and the aliens fell all over themselves apologizing. They then presumed that the others were the shapeshifter’s <strong>pets</strong>.</p>
<p>It had some drama, but it was funny. The PCs got caught up in the confusion as I wanted, pieced together the problem, and solved it, but nobody got like…imprisoned or anything.</p>
