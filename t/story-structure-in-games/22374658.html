          <p>To slightly reiterate my point above in different light: structure is important because of the <em>stories we are culturally primed to expect</em>. That‚Äôs why prescriptive structure rarely works (or rather, rarely feels inspired or artistic) in either movies or games. Having rules for resolving acts could work in the right mix‚Äìlike, it might be part of my ‚Äúnext game only 100 people will like‚Äù which will be about Modernist drama‚Äìbut even there you need to have a lot of room for things to work out. Rather, formal understanding of structure is better for sniffing out the shapes of stories and possibly holding‚Äìlightly! Very lightly!‚Äìthings you might want to see happen to pull the story into that arc.</p>
<p>Basically we do this instinctively as humans within our own cultural spheres. It‚Äôs easier for some people and harder for others and that‚Äôs no shame. Knowing some stuff about structure will maybe make your instincts stronger. Or just watching a lot of stories with good structure. Some of these will be masterpieces (the ‚ÄúThree Colors‚Äù trilogy is some of the greatest screenwriting ever) and some will be just good genre movies (‚ÄúDie Hard‚Äù has an unbelievably solid structure that hits all of the important story beats.)</p>
<p>Then after that you can approach games. Like, ‚ÄúLady Blackbird‚Äù has a classic three act structure! I mean, it doesn‚Äôt have to get played that way, but there‚Äôs a certain gravity to the map, the locations, and the situations** that push it into that kind of a structure.</p>
<p>The other thing is to GM by the clock <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> this is something running hundreds of two-hour slots taught me. No cliffhangers, resolve each session with some kind of climax in the last 45 minutes, and maybe do a reveal for next time <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>*Harmon‚Äôs an asshole, but is one of the most serious students of structure in screenwriting today<br>
**Study Cyrus &amp; Natasha‚Äôs Keys, note how paying them off makes for a very strong dramatic story, for example. Harper is a genius of stuffing setting into rules.</p>
