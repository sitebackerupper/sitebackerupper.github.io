<p>Can you give an example of how you get invested in a longer-term arc? Because I noticed a tendency myself that people just start to play themselves after a few sessions.</p>

<p>Sorry, I’ve been reading this thread and really enjoying it, I guess I’ve been somewhat sheepish to contribute too much since others have quite a bit of experience and are saying very smart things!</p>
<p>For me, I really enjoyed building a shared history, and then sort of playing to that. Often, a mix of chemistry, chance, and stats can take your character in a way you didn’t expect. I once played a paladin in DW who, due to a mix of factors, started heavily skirting his code (a sort of bad lieutenant type) in a way I never would have expected when I made the character. And then as we played, it was fun to sort of tie what was happening to the shared history of the game. Being able to sort of create that together can be very satisfying. In my experience, people don’t just play themselves…I feel like over time their character builds up history and then they can play to that. There are a lot of factors.</p>
<p>I do also think that real character advancement mechanics can be pretty fun and exciting. This relates to another thread on crunch I made but I think it’s relevant. I’m trying to get into a VTM game and am making a character and you know, I have to make a lot of compromises, which feed into my character…as I level, I’ll have to choose what I care about, and the mechanics can serve to crystallize that. Do I want to be a better killer, or a better schmoozer? That will reflect the needs of the chronicle, as well as the character he’s proven to be and the character he wants to be. And then with that change, he will get more competent, which in turn will change how the narrative moves.</p>
<p>I find that stuff all very fun!</p>

          <p>I think one shots can be fun, and at a convention are a good way to play a game when you might not have been able to do. But, I also feel most games become more interesting the more time you invest with them. The choices you make each session become more meaningful. You end up caring about the characters more. With a lot of OSR games people start of playing generic adventure person that will slowly evolve through sessions into an actual character. I think campaign play is often the most compelling aspect of an RPG. And the RPG games I look back on most fondly have all been parts of longer campaigns.</p>
<p>Trying to make games that work as compelling one shots seems like a good goal, because people often don’t have the time to play a long campaign. A lot of D&amp;D adventure I have seen in recent years seem built with the idea you could play them in a convention sized slot. (Basically everything from DCCRPG for example.) Many indie games seem built this way as well. I think games that purposefully try and come to a nest conclusion work better here. Otherwise you just leave wanting more. Maybe not the worst way to feel after a game, though.</p>

          <p>I’d rather leave a game wanting more than thinking “Thank goodness we’re finally done with that.” which, alas, has been my sensation after several campaigns.  On the other hand, it was also my sensation after a one shot of classic Traveller, and similarly a one shot of The Dark Eye, so clearly one-shots aren’t immune from this.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the fun things about one shots is that you don’t HAVE to stop (well, unless it was a con game).  If you play a oneshot and everyone goes “That was AMAZING! I really want to go back and see what happens next!” it’s usually a possibility that you can do just that.</p>
