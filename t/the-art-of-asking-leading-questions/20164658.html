<p>We all play in our bubbles. Gauntlet players will have a high ‚Äúnarrative inteligence,‚Äù but not all groups will have that. I encountered players who come from a very trad approach with an antagonistic GM and they feel threathened when you start declaring stuff about the only thing they can control in the game world. So I have put it in the original post as a fail safe. I will edit that post to make it more clear <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <p>You sure can!</p>
<p>I just chose the above approach based on my group, but each group and each player will be different. For me this was the ‚Äúsafest‚Äù way of getting them familiar with such narrative game approach. Start will small details, build upwards.</p>
<p>Some of my players were not comfortable breaking the traditional GM/Player split, so I chose to just build up slowly for everyone, so no one feels left out. It worked for our group, you might find a different approach works for you <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I think I should have specified that my advice was just that - advice. You might need to tweak it, so it works with your group <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, establishing questions are a really wonderful way to figure out a leading question to ask. ‚ÄúIs your mother dead?‚Äù is a great question, but it‚Äôs not a leading question. If the PC is in a mansion owned by someone they‚Äôre trying to convince to something (funding a quest, freeing a prisoner, whatever), you might ask ‚Äúas you‚Äôre waiting in the sitting room, what on the mantle over the fireplace reminds you of your dead mother?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, in that case, I‚Äôm not into leading questions at all, mostly because there is no way of structuring them. You can go from from small things to ridiculous large ideas:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTell me why the world is falling apart?‚Äù<br>
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTell me something about what you character discovered about particle mass‚Äù<br>
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTell me your point of view of the correlation between lebens raum and today‚Äôs right wing movement.‚Äù</p>
<p>The OP should had been asked in that case: ‚Äúwhy are we asking leading questions?‚Äù</p>
<p>For me, I have a playstyle where the players can make up pretty anything, as long as it makes sense (given the setting and situation; which the group have agreed upon), and I have techniques to make them comfortable in having a larger influence than just their character. I also play a lot of <em>collaborative storytelling</em>, and when someone is describing ‚Äì for example ‚Äì the surroundings when setting a scene, I can ask them ‚ÄúHas it rained?‚Äù. I pretty much wants it to rain, but I have had people saying ‚ÄúNo, but it‚Äôs snowing‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs actually quite sunny‚Äù and having them taking a stand. Either way will satisfy me.</p>
<p>I do ask leading questions like yours if it‚Äôs during character creation. It‚Äôs basically trying to hook the players into something interesting. If they don‚Äôt bite, I leave it at that. My biggest concern, however, is that your ‚Äúmum portrait‚Äù example is forcing the player to make it interesting, because you do that while playing. That‚Äôs taking it too far, for me. I have been doing that myself, and gotten bad feedback afterwards from players, and I have been in situations where someone else have put me in the spot by doing that. (I play in all sorts of groups, often at convention so it‚Äôs almost always different participants doing that.)</p>
<p>So ‚Ä¶ I stopped doing that.</p>
