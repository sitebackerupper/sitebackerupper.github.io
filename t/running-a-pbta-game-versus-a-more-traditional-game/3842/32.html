          <p>I think <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/airk">@Airk</a> pointing at uncertainty is really key here. Forgive me, but… all of this makes me think of some pretty 50,000 foot RPG theory! Let me see if I can be succinct about it.</p>
<p>One of the big questions for me as a designer is “why do we use dice/cards/randomizers to tell these stories?” In my experience, we invoke these randomizers to <em>declaim responsibility</em> about outcomes. If your paladin tries to kill an orc, we can say:</p>
<ul>
<li>sure, you do it.</li>
<li>no, you don’t do it</li>
<li><em>let’s roll some dice!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The outcome is predicated on the group’s understanding of the uncertainty. You don’t roll dice to tie your shoes (sure, you do it) or to travel through time (no, you don’t do it), but there are plenty of situations in which the game is stronger because we don’t already have a clear sense of the outcome when the action is taken. That’s the secret sauce of RPGs imo: we are telling a story we do not yet know.</p>
<p>So the real question for me in any system I’m working in/running is “What things require me (the GM) to declaim responsibility for the outcome? When can I say ‘yes/no’ and when do I have to invoke the mechanics of the game to see how things play out?”</p>
<p>In OSR games, the task-based nature of the game tends to create situations of uncertainty around <em>accomplishment</em>, i.e. we roll dice to see whether or not you can do the thing. But the GM has to have some limits on that declamation. If a PC tries to throw a rock into space, then the GM has the authority to say “I’m not declaiming responsibility for this outcome; you can’t do it.” Thus, if the PCs find a way in the fiction to kill a monster or overcome a trap in a way that satisfies the fictional position of the situation, then there is no roll because there is no uncertainty.</p>
<p>I think that all scans for most folks even if they are new to the concept of uncertainty and declaiming responsibility for outcomes. What’s strange for most players is how PbtA games handle uncertainty, a concept made more opaque by many published games that fail to use it wisely.</p>
<p>In PbtA games, we still only roll when the outcome is uncertain. If you shoot an incapacitated dude in the head at point blank range in <em>Apocalypse World (1e)</em>, then that dude is dead. There’s no roll, no <em>seizing by force</em>, no _going aggro. If I’m the GM, I look at those outcomes (harm, impress/frighten/etc) and I think “All of this is known. This guy dies. The cost is a bullet.” But if that guy is standing up and shooting at you, then all those stakes suddenly spring to life and the outcome is uncertain enough to merit a roll.</p>
<p>But PbtA is <strong>built on a framework of moves</strong> instead of tasks. Those moves don’t describe your ability to do or not do a thing—although some designers make the mistake of thinking that’s what moves do—as much as they highlight a point of categorical uncertainty. Cartel, for example, says that the stakes of shooting someone invoke harm, sure, but the moves around violence also invoke <em>collateral damage</em> and <em>resisting stress</em>. In other words, the violence in Cartel is always uncertain because the stakes for violence are about what happens to everyone around the violence when violence is done.</p>
<p>So in many PbtA games, broad triggers (<a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jasont">@JasonT</a>) require judgement calls. Are you <em>fleeing from the dead</em> if you get in your car and drive away from a swarm of zombies? Or does it only trigger when you try to get away from them on foot? That’s up to the GM (and group) to adjudicate, but as long as the conversation relies on uncertainty—“Yeah, I think there’s no roll here because all of the stakes are about failing to flee the zombies and I think you’re fine in the car”—then you’re running the game correctly.</p>
<p>So in my mind:</p>
<p>OSR: you are in this situation and you do something clever, so don’t roll the dice. Good job!<br>
PbtA: you are in a situation that the game has hard-coded as “uncertain,” so we will resolve the outcome of that uncertainty in the way the move has described. If you somehow removed the uncertainty, you wouldn’t have to roll!</p>
<p>So in essence, I think you’re right that “cleverness in PbtA is a function of triggering or not triggering moves” because that’s where the tactical play lies! If you don’t want to <em>get in someone’s face</em> in ZW because you’ve got a low Savagery, then… don’t trigger the move! Find a different move to trigger to get what you want with a stronger roll… or find a way to avoid moves entirely and resolve it without any uncertainty.</p>

          <p>There are some great answers here. I agree that lumping all PbtA games together is likely dangerous or confusing (because there are so many now!), and I’m not familiar with Zombie World, but I’ll say the following:</p>
<p>I can speak for Apocalypse World and its cousins by designers close enough to the source (e.g. Monsterhearts, Sagas of the Icelanders, Masks). Those are intended to be played in an <em>absolutely fundamentally different way</em> from OSR adventure games. They have a different creative goal.</p>
<p>(This is muddled a great detail by Dungeon World and its descendants, which do not have a clear creative direction or goal in the same way.)</p>
<p>There are enough common procedures between OSR games and PbtA games that it’s easy to get confused, but I wouldn’t want to play in either style with the mechanics and procedures of the other.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/funkaoshi">@funkaoshi</a>, let’s get together and chat over coffee or beer, or play one together. I’ve got a lot more I could say in person, in interactive dialogue, and we don’t live too far apart!</p>
<p>In my opinion:</p>
<p>Many of the rules and procedures in OSR style “adventure games” are designed to create repeatable and reliable procedures for the fair adjudication of particular actions and events. They are usually symmetrical, which helps with impartial resolution. Impartial resolution can be used for creating and addressing challenge, and works really well when you use it right. A turn sequence and wandering monster checks, for example, make spending time in a dungeon a risky and interesting game proposition, requiring players to make tough choices. This is enabled by following the procedures strictly and <em>consistently</em>.</p>
<p>In PbtA designs, almost all the procedures are fundamentally <em>asymmetrical</em>: they are not designed to allow for impartial resolution, but rather to move around spotlight and to focus on certain characters, moments, and themes. They are about shining a light on a particular character, a particular moment, and to highlight a certain theme. That’s what good players/groups do in order to make them work.</p>
<p>There is almost no guarantee (or need!) that two similar situations will be resolved the same way, and that’s by design: the system allows us to express ourselves and the themes of the game in play in a flexible way.</p>
<p>There are some games that reliably get at their themes simply by iterating the procedures (e.g. Dogs in the Vineyard), but, in my opinion, PbtA games are not like that. They are similar enough to “traditional” RPGs that it’s really easy to play them without getting the desired playstyle.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/funkaoshi">@funkaoshi</a> - seriously, send me a PM! Let’s get together.</p>

</aside>
<p>If it’s not too much trouble, could you expand upon this? I think it’s an interesting way to frame the issue,  because at least as I’ve understood your framing, when a PbtA game is giving each participant more narrative control, it’s going to reduce occurrences of “non-optimal” uncertainty. In a non-PbtA game, if a violent and dangerous monster is charging at a combat-poor character, that character has somewhat limited options on how to respond; but choosing between three different kinds of hell is exciting and tense, and makes success against crazy odds hugely dramatic. If I’m understanding what you’ve wrote correctly, in a PbtA game where the GM does not have as much narrative control they will be forced to spin the story more reactively and thus can’t squeeze a player in the quite the same way. Doing so to an unreasonable degree is bullying, but at the same time I think the most dramatic beats of a story are challenging characters with their weaknesses rather than their strengths.</p>

          <p>I actually don’t think it’s that clear cut. In a lot of OSR style play, the characters go forth to encounter danger and trouble. They seek it out and choose what challenges to confront.</p>
<p>In a PbtA game, the MC is expected to mess around with the characters and throw them trouble they can’t deal with easily.</p>
<p>Most games have some kind of XP trigger complex which incentivizes players to make moves they’re “bad at”, as well.</p>
<p>So it can go both ways.</p>

<p>as I’ve understood your framing, when a PbtA game is giving each participant more narrative control, it’s going to reduce occurrences of “non-optimal” uncertainty.</p>

<p>I’d love to say more, but I don’t think I really understand what you mean here. Can you give me an example of a PbtA game that “gives each participant more narrative control”?</p>

          <p>Most PbtA games, and specifically the culture around MCing them, communal world building and “provocative questions”, certainly do end up giving the players much more influence over the contents of the game.</p>
<p>However, the focus is different. In fun PbtA play, the players use that freedom to create problems for themselves.</p>

          <p>I think <em><strong>disclaiming responsibility</strong></em> as per what <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/lumpley">@lumpley</a> and Meguey suggest in <em>Apocalypse World</em> (pg 86 in 2e) is key here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• <em><strong>Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.</strong></em> In order to play to and out what happens, you’ll need to pass decision-making off sometimes. Whenever something comes up that you’d prefer not to decide by personal whim and will, don’t. The game gives you four key tools you can use to disclaim responsibility: you can <em><strong>put it in your NPCs’ hands</strong></em>, you can <em><strong>put it in the players’ hands</strong></em>, you can <em><strong>create a countdown</strong></em>, or you can <em><strong>make it a stakes question</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming there are interesting and meaningful things that could come out of what happens you as the GM can sometimes decide that what <em>you</em> want to have happen in the game might influence things in an unfair way, so you want to take yourself out of the picture… One of the ways you can do this is to let the dice decide. John Harper appears to be a big fan of this since it’s basically the whole idea behind both <em>The Die of Fate</em> in <em>World of Dungeons</em> and the <em>Fortune Roll</em> in <em>Blades in the Dark</em>.</p>
<p>But I think it can be even more generalized than that, going back to the <em><strong>Roll dice or say yes</strong></em> dictum: if there is a real chance for a specific action to lead to multiple different interesting outcomes/situations, then engage the system’s mechanics, if not, then the action just happens. And this lines up just fine with OSR views of fictional positioning removing the need for rolls. You as the GM listen to what they say they are doing and you decide that based on all their setup it’s unlikely to fail, so no roll is needed.</p>

          <p>The single example that probably helped me get into this the most was a short one in Monster of the Week, where they talk about how if you’re shooting a zombie with a gun, you’re not triggering the “Kick Some Ass” move (which requires both sides to be able to get in a fight), you’re just dealing damage, and the proper response for the GM in that situation is probably “deal Harm as established” (in this case, dealing Harm to the zombie). (This would be a great example of a clever idea to avoid the risk of the dice!)</p>
<p>Add that to “make a GM Move when the table looks to you to see what happens”, and there’s a pretty clear second option for when you feel like you should be rolling dice: just make a GM Move. Have something happen. There’s going to be a lot of situations where it feels like there should be a die roll, and a lot of times the proper answer to that is going to be “something happens”. I think that answering that itch with “I make a GM Move” is probably the single-biggest change I’ve made to my GMing/MCing, for the better. (This includes making GM Moves that benefit players!)</p>
<p>And a lot of times, the clear answer is to engage one of the player-facing moves, so you do that. But GM Moves are a good, compact way to handle unclear situations.</p>

<p>Ah, yes! I do think that an OSR-GM has a different set of priorities than a PbtA-GM, namely that the OSR-GM can prioritize player agency by presenting an interesting world full of opportunities instead of needing to push the players into situations that require the pre-designed moves.</p>

<p>In a PbtA game,  The players have more power and authority, based on the moves and the rules and the principles of the game.  As a result, however, the GM isn’t limited by having to fight fair: you are allowed and expected to hit them <em>precisely</em> where it hurts, because they have the tools to deal with it.</p>

          <p>My jam is somewhere in the intersection between OSR and story-gaming, and PbtA is my preferred ruleset at the moment. I like a lot of the trappings of OSR-style play, but I prefer the “play to find out what happens” mindset of PbtA and other story-games.</p>
<p>I think the big difference between OSR and story-gaming is the handling of narrative control.</p>
<p>In OSR and other traditional games (D&amp;D, Pathfinder, GURPS, Champions, etc), the GM pretty much holds narrative control exclusively. In these games, the GM tends to take a more god-like role, where they mostly dictate what’s going on with everything, other than the PCs’ direct actions. The narrative is what the GM says it is, whether by fiat, by following a printed adventure (more-or-less), or by interpreting the results of dice rolls.</p>
<p>In PbtA, the fiction is a conversation between the GM and the players, and the storyline is built more-or-less by consensus between the players and the GM. For many moves, the GM will provide the <em>players</em> fictional options to choose between, or will throw the narration itself to the players.</p>

          <p>Kind of a tangent, but i think “play to find out what happens” is a pretty core tenant of OSR play. People obsess over not railroading players, quantum ogres, and all that nonsense. The approach is different, is all. I think building the story by consensus isn’t a core tenant of PbtA games as well, just something that seems to be common to many. A lot of the examples of play in the AW book feel pretty “trad” in how they play out. Calling the GM “god-like” also seems out of place in a game you’re playing with your friends. The GM is another player.</p>

          <p>I agree; There’ve been a number of discussions here over the past few months about PbtA and OSR play/style, and having followed several, and participated in a few, I have arrived at the conclusion that the only meaningful difference between the two is the focus of play.  OSR play is challenge based, and “overcoming stuff” and “not dying” are serious parts of the playstyle (This is why I personally have zero interest in the OSR – if I wanted a challenge I wouldn’t be playing an RPG) while PbtA has its focus shifted towards the “dramatically interesting.”</p>
<p>Otherwise? Things are largely the same – yes, PbtA games have some components like “ask questions and use the answers” which are not standard in OSR play, but which are generally not incompatible with it either.  Yes, the OSR places greater emphasis on “prep” than PbtA games, but again, not actually incompatible with most PbtA games (in spite of what you might read in some parts of the internet).</p>
<p>This is why I’m always a little bit confused by how people seem to regard PbtA games as weird and difficult.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, the biggest differences might be mechanical, with PBTA using 2d6 resolution dice, and utilizing an array of better-defined “moves”, while games descended from D&amp;D use d20 resolution dice and allowing for mostly freeform “actions” (with “attack” and “use skill” being almost the only two that are defined well enough to be named).</p>
<p>I mean, there are other differences, but they seem more stylistic to me, and mostly a matter of convention rather than anything that’s required by the rules.</p>

          <p>I could very easily create an OSR game that uses 2d6 resolution, or a PbtA game that uses a d20.</p>
<p>This thread from July does a really good job of outlining the differences: <a href="../../pbta-3-osr-can-the-design-philosophies-be-combined/2717.html" class="inline-onebox">PBTA &lt;3 OSR? Can the design philosophies be combined?</a></p>

          <p>I agree, I’d see rolling in a Pbta closer to a reward (oh my god something exciting is about to happen, weither I succeed or fail), whereas in OSR-like style it’s more like a necessary risk or even a punishment.</p>

          <p>This feels like a really succinct summary as well. Rolling introduces complications, which in a lot of PbtA games is what the players in the game (GM included) wants. With OSR games that complication is a chance for failure you are usually trying to avoid.</p>
