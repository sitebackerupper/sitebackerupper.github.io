          <p>I think <em><strong>disclaiming responsibility</strong></em> as per what <a class="mention" href="../../../external.html?link=https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/lumpley">@lumpley</a> and Meguey suggest in <em>Apocalypse World</em> (pg 86 in 2e) is key here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¢ <em><strong>Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.</strong></em> In order to play to and out what happens, you‚Äôll need to pass decision-making off sometimes. Whenever something comes up that you‚Äôd prefer not to decide by personal whim and will, don‚Äôt. The game gives you four key tools you can use to disclaim responsibility: you can <em><strong>put it in your NPCs‚Äô hands</strong></em>, you can <em><strong>put it in the players‚Äô hands</strong></em>, you can <em><strong>create a countdown</strong></em>, or you can <em><strong>make it a stakes question</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming there are interesting and meaningful things that could come out of what happens you as the GM can sometimes decide that what <em>you</em> want to have happen in the game might influence things in an unfair way, so you want to take yourself out of the picture‚Ä¶ One of the ways you can do this is to let the dice decide. John Harper appears to be a big fan of this since it‚Äôs basically the whole idea behind both <em>The Die of Fate</em> in <em>World of Dungeons</em> and the <em>Fortune Roll</em> in <em>Blades in the Dark</em>.</p>
<p>But I think it can be even more generalized than that, going back to the <em><strong>Roll dice or say yes</strong></em> dictum: if there is a real chance for a specific action to lead to multiple different interesting outcomes/situations, then engage the system‚Äôs mechanics, if not, then the action just happens. And this lines up just fine with OSR views of fictional positioning removing the need for rolls. You as the GM listen to what they say they are doing and you decide that based on all their setup it‚Äôs unlikely to fail, so no roll is needed.</p>

          <p>The single example that probably helped me get into this the most was a short one in Monster of the Week, where they talk about how if you‚Äôre shooting a zombie with a gun, you‚Äôre not triggering the ‚ÄúKick Some Ass‚Äù move (which requires both sides to be able to get in a fight), you‚Äôre just dealing damage, and the proper response for the GM in that situation is probably ‚Äúdeal Harm as established‚Äù (in this case, dealing Harm to the zombie). (This would be a great example of a clever idea to avoid the risk of the dice!)</p>
<p>Add that to ‚Äúmake a GM Move when the table looks to you to see what happens‚Äù, and there‚Äôs a pretty clear second option for when you feel like you should be rolling dice: just make a GM Move. Have something happen. There‚Äôs going to be a lot of situations where it feels like there should be a die roll, and a lot of times the proper answer to that is going to be ‚Äúsomething happens‚Äù. I think that answering that itch with ‚ÄúI make a GM Move‚Äù is probably the single-biggest change I‚Äôve made to my GMing/MCing, for the better. (This includes making GM Moves that benefit players!)</p>
<p>And a lot of times, the clear answer is to engage one of the player-facing moves, so you do that. But GM Moves are a good, compact way to handle unclear situations.</p>

<p>Ah, yes! I do think that an OSR-GM has a different set of priorities than a PbtA-GM, namely that the OSR-GM can prioritize player agency by presenting an interesting world full of opportunities instead of needing to push the players into situations that require the pre-designed moves.</p>

          <p>That‚Äôs exactly right, in my opinion!</p>
<p>In a PbtA game,  The players have more power and authority, based on the moves and the rules and the principles of the game.  As a result, however, the GM isn‚Äôt limited by having to fight fair: you are allowed and expected to hit them <em>precisely</em> where it hurts, because they have the tools to deal with it.</p>
