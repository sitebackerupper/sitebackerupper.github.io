          <h3>About this post</h3>
<p>This initial post was copied from the document created for <a href="https://gauntlet-rpg.slack.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">The Gauntlet Slack</a>. That document can be found online at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/GauntletJargon101" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tinyurl.com/GauntletJargon101</a>.</p>
<p>This is a wiki post, so those with appropriate trust levels (Trust Level 1 and above) can edit it. You can find more about wiki posts at: <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-is-a-wiki-post/30801" rel="nofollow noopener">https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-is-a-wiki-post/30801</a></p>
<h3>About abbreviations and jargon</h3>
<p>In conversations on <a href="../../index.html">The Gauntlet Forums</a> and other social media platforms, it is best practice to first spell out what you plan to abbreviate. This prevents people from missing out on the conversation. Although others are encouraged to ask without hesitation, if they need clarification, sometimes these conversations are found after the members have moved on. Better to fix the problem before it starts!</p>
<h3>Jargon related to the Gauntlet culture</h3>
<p>These are terms that were embraced or invented by the Gauntlet, and are about the culture of play (instead of specifically about game systems).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/the-7-3-1-technique" rel="nofollow noopener">7-3-1</a>: A game prep technique of identifying 7 set pieces (NPCs, locations, objects, etc.), 3 descriptive details about each, and 1 way of embodying each at the table (voice, mannerisms, noises, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong>: Two or more linked series. Though a GM may require that players be able to attend each game session in a series, each series in a campaign must allow open sign-ups. Refer to open table and series.</p>
<p><strong>CATS</strong>: A structure for expectation-setting conversations at the game table in which GM and players agree on the game‚Äôs Concept, Aim, Tone, and Subject matter. Refer to <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/RPG-CATS-cs-3x5" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.tinyurl.com/RPG-CATS-cs-3x5</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Derole</strong>: To shift from inhabiting a character‚Äôs mental space into the player‚Äôs regular mindset, usually as part of a short break between game session and debrief.</p>
<p><strong>Dreams</strong>: Usually in the form of ‚Äúdreams to [person] for [reason].‚Äù Roughly similar to kudos or a star, though not usually used in the context of a single game session. Refer to stars and wishes. Inspired by the mechanic in <em>Golden Sky Stories</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Lines and Veils</strong>: A pre-game safety mechanic inviting players to identify things they do not want to see in the game at all (lines) and things they want kept offscreen, faded to black, or glossed over (veils). A line functions much like a preemptive x-card. Lines and Veils  were originally discussed by Ron Edwards in a piece called Sex and  Sorcery.</p>
<p><strong>Love Letter</strong>: A short note from the GM to a player who missed one or more sessions about what their character was up to in the interim, sometimes with a custom move attached to determine how well it went.</p>
<p><strong>Open Table</strong>: A philosophy of allowing anyone to sign up to play. All games on the Gauntlet Hangouts calendar are open table. GMs may occasionally require that players be able to attend all sessions in a series, but most series on the calendar allow players to RSVP for any or all sessions as they wish.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/paint-the-scene" rel="nofollow noopener">Painting the Scene</a>: Asking players to provide details that reinforce a theme. (ex., ‚ÄúWhat tells you that this is a town of the Faithful?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat in the room shows that Chad isn‚Äôt a complete douchebag?‚Äù)</p>
<p><strong>Polling the Table</strong>: Asking players what they‚Äôre thinking of doing before breaking out dice.</p>
<p><strong>Roses and Thorns</strong>: A debrief technique in which players describe something they liked during the session (a rose) and something that they didn‚Äôt like or that didn‚Äôt work for them (a thorn). Contrast with stars and wishes.</p>
<p><strong>Script Change</strong>: <a href="https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change" rel="nofollow noopener">Script Change</a> is a safety, consent, and content moderation toolbox by <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/briebeau">@BrieBeau</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Series</strong>: A numbered set of game sessions on the Hangouts Calendar. There is often a preference, but not a requirement, that players be able to attend each session.</p>
<p><strong>Stars and Wishes</strong>: A debrief technique in which players describe something they liked during a session, often something another participant did (a star), and flag something they hope to see in the future (a wish). Contrast with roses and thorns.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">X-card</a>: A safety mechanic used during game sessions when a player needs something cut. No justification or explanation are needed. In Gauntlet games, this is usually signaled by a player holding up an X formed with their arms or fingers. The Gauntlet requires the x-card be available and honored in all Gauntlet games. The X-Card was created by John Stavropoulos.</p>
<h3>Abbreviations related to RPG game systems and podcasts</h3>
<p>These are abbreviations of game devices or systems that often are found on the Gauntlet Slack. Some obvious ones that don‚Äôt come up often in our conversations (such as ‚ÄúD&amp;D‚Äù) can be found doing a simple Google searches as well.</p>

<p>FitD = <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/licensing" rel="nofollow noopener">Forged in the Dark</a>, basically the licensing for running games using Blades in the Dark system. Sort of like the <em>PbtA</em> label, but for <em>Blades in the Dark</em>-type games instead of <em>Apocalypse World</em>-type games.</p>
<p>FoaBD = Fear of a Black Dragon</p>
<p>FtF, F2F, f2f = face to face</p>

<p>OSR = Old School Renaissance/Revival</p>
<p>PbP = play by post</p>
<p>PbtA = Powered by the Apocalypse</p>
<p>PSP = Pocket-Sized Play</p>
<p>SCUP = <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/239692/The-Sword-The-Crown-and-The-Unspeakable-Power" rel="nofollow noopener">The Sword, the Crown, and the Unspeakable Power</a>, a dark fantasy RPG reminiscent of the A Song of Ice and Fire and stories that focus on power, politics, and intrigue.</p>
<p>SotDL = Shadow of the Demon Lord</p>
<p>SotI = Sagas of the Icelanders</p>
<p>SWvM = <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/169564/Space-Wurm-vs-Moonicorn" rel="nofollow noopener">Space Wurm vs. Moonicorn</a>, a PbtA Dungeon World and Monster Hearts hack about interstellar drama, by Johnstone Metzger.</p>
<p>US = <a href="http://www.magpiegames.com/our-games/urban-shadows/" rel="nofollow noopener">Urban Shadows</a>, a PbtA dark urban fantasy game about faction politics by Magpie Games.</p>
<p>VtM, VtR = <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> and <em>Vampire: The Requiem</em> respectively</p>
<p>WHtK, WHtK! = <a href="http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/we-hunt-the-keepers" rel="nofollow noopener">We Hunt the Keepers</a>, a number of series and campaigns that are interlinked, run by Jason Cordova with the Gauntlet community, generally using Dungeon World. Also a series of recorded actual plays of these games released in podcast form.</p>
<p>WoD = Usually used to mean World of Darkness outside of our community, but occasionally used for World of Dungeons (which is more commonly abbreviated WoDu).</p>
<p>WoDu = <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979_bw.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">World of Dungeons</a>, a simplified, freely available Dungeon World hack by John Harper.</p>
<p>WWW = <a href="https://ndpdesign.com/wwwrpg/" rel="nofollow noopener">World Wide Wrestling</a>, a PbtA wrestling RPG by Nathan Paoletta.</p>
<h3>Abbreviations and jargon related to conversations in general</h3>
<p>Many of these can probably be found by doing Google searches and are commonly used in our modern age, but are placed here because they crop up regularly in conversations.</p>
<p>IIRC = If I recall correctly</p>
<p>IKR = I know, right?</p>
<p>IMO, IMHO = In my opinion, In my humble opinion</p>
<p>IRL = In real life</p>
<p>TFW = The feeling when</p>
<h3>Using abbreviations in posts</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôre willing to make an extra effort, you can use the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> tag in your posts. To use this tag write the abbreviation like this: <code>&lt;abbr title="LONG DESCRIPTION"&gt;ABBREVIATION&lt;/abbr&gt;</code>. It can be annoying but sometimes it can be helpful, especially if it‚Äôs not a very common abbreviation.</p>
<p>For example, adding <code>&lt;abbr title="The feeling when"&gt;TFW&lt;/abbr&gt;</code>, will produce this: <abbr title="The feeling when">TFW</abbr> (hover your mouse over the underlined TFW)</p>
