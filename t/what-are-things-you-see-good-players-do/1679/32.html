          <p>In our community, playing your character with your heart is highly valued. Emotionally identifying with the character and what happens in the game, but also playing them with an eye to human foibles big and small. (Sometimes called playing to lose.) When I think of who I want to play with, this is a very important consideration.</p>

          <p>Everything here is great, the only thing I’d add is:</p>
<p><strong>Take NPCs seriously.</strong> Try to understand their motives, work with them, against them, love them, hate them, whatever. The specifics depend largely on the tone of the game, just don’t be the player who’s yawning (or rolling their eyes) when the GM is bringing it with an NPC.</p>

          <p>Jmstar already mentioned this in his excellent list, but I want to underline how much I appreciate it when players have clear in-character goals. Having a goal means you’ve taken the time to understand your character to at least a base level, and it gives the session propulsion from the get-go. And if you have a clear goal, it makes spotlighting you easier, both as a GM and as another player. Even if it’s something small, something that would be the C-plot on an hour long TV drama, I want to know what my fellow players want so I can think about how to help them get it or complicate their efforts.</p>

<p>The non-interruptive feedback is something I think you get really good at when playing Gauntlet Hangouts games. You mute yourself all the time but also not being in the room with others means you can visibly clap, shake your fists, bring your hands to your mouth in shock, etc. All of that is <em>super</em> motivating for the people with the spotlight. You see it in the little squares in the corner and it just amps you up.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is so true. Some of the coolest moments in the games I’ve played have been seeing everyone’s expressions, applause, etc. when the onscreen player is doing cool stuff.</p>

          <p>You people are plain <strong>amazing</strong>. There is so much brilliant advice in this thread.<br>
I’d like to add another level to the “be bold/play interesting” dimension (excuse the profanity):</p>
<p><strong>Embrace the suck!</strong></p>
<p>It is allright to feel disapointet, frustrated and even angry - as long as it is feelings about your PC, that you’re <em>sharing</em>. It’s actually exciting and powerful, that RPGs enable us to feel this way. Embrace your failures, embrace the loss of narrative choice and embrace that your feelings might actually be inconvient.<br>
<em>Obviously this is not about feelings, that are actually hurting you as a person - the player. This is about emotions concerning solely the character and its role in the fiction.</em><br>
Enjoy the drama unfolding, enjoy the tragedy you get to experience from within the safe space, we strive to create collaboratively. It is part of the amazing ride you’re in for. And it will lead you to new places, you’d never have gone, if you stayed in control all the time.<br>
EDIT: So it is not just about playing bold and risky beforehand - but also about celebrating the negative consequences, that arise through this playing style.</p>
<p>My principle for this kind of emotional buy-in is: <em>Identify with the character, don’t identify the character with you.</em> (I’d be happy to have a native speaker rephrase this in a little more ‘poetic’ manner.)</p>
<p><em>EDIT: I also think GMing and playing in GMless games, teaches you a lot about the love for failure.</em></p>

          <p>I love this thread. I have a question.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/whodo">@whodo</a> mentioned taking time between sessions to “learn what your character can do…how their character works mechanically”<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jmstar">@Jmstar</a> listed “absorb the rules and use them vigorously.”</p>
<p>Is willingness to deeply grasp a game’s system/setting/genre a characteristic of a good player (especially when doing so means investing effort outside of a live game session)?</p>
<p>I’ve noticed that a number of systems or settings I’m interested in exploring aren’t really feasible these days (at least among my groups) because even great players are generally averse to demands that go beyond live session time. Is this just a difference between traditional and less traditional games’ expectations of player responsibility? Or is it really just a matter of age (as in, older players stereotypically have less time to spare on the hobby)?</p>

<p>Is willingness to deeply grasp a game’s system/setting/genre a characteristic of a good player (especially when doing so means investing effort outside of a live game session)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think that yes, this is a characteristic of good players, but not a necessary one. Like, you can be a great player without doing this, but it’s helpful if you do do it. And a little bit goes a long way - even just daydreaming about your character and the world on the commute over to game night does wonders for getting you in the mood and sparking ideas.</p>
<p>But this is super group dependent. And game dependent. I really don’t want to have to sit around and wait for people to take their turn in 5e combat, but it’s a little easier if a player is skating by in a PBTA game.</p>

          <p>So I feel like I might need to clarify on my original post a bit. That thought has mostly come from two aspects that I have experienced repeatedly. I mostly play trad games so it may be that the dynamics work differently with indie games where the balance of expectations/power dynamics are different.</p>
<p>The first aspect is the assertion that its ok for a player to not put in any time outside the session but that its expected from the GM. It just wouldn’t fly if a GM showed up with a rule book and they’d not read a single page of the rules. With trad games especially there is an unspoken expectation that the GM will, at a minimum, have spent the time to learn the game so I don’t feel it is unreasonable to expect the players to do the same. If they’re really adverse to doing it outside of the game then put some time aside during game time. Make it part of session 0 or set aside the first 15 minutes of a session to go over rules/make notes etc.</p>
<p>The second aspect is related to the actual play experience. I’ve run campaigns and listened to APs where even by the end of the campaign there was a player (sometimes more than 1) who still couldn’t follow even the base mechanics. So I could have been clearer in my original post - I wasn’t necessarily talking about complete system mastery but the core mechanics, such as how to make an attack roll in D&amp;D or the specifics of the ability you use every session. Not knowing that 2 sessions in to a new campaign? Fine. Not knowing that 20 sessions in and having to get the GM to walk you through it <em>again</em>, not so fine (as you might be able to tell this is a personal bugbear of mine).</p>
<p>So directly responding to your question - Yes, I think a willingness to learn the system is a mark of a good player, especially in trad games where there is an assumption that the GM will be required to do a lot of work outside of sessions.</p>
<p>Is there a difference between traditional and indie expectations? Yes and no. I think indie games often do a better job of distributing responsibilities, which is helped by the fact that they also tend towards simpler rulesets. There is still an expectation though that the GM/facilitator/whoever brings the game to the group will know all the rules in advance and be able to teach them so you could run into the same issue of players not learning them over time.</p>
<p>Aside - I think it is also something where developers could do a lot to help by including core system reference/cheat sheets for the players - my experience with PbtA games is that while the playbook format can be overwhelming at first having a list of all the moves in front of each player is ultimately a massive help in grasping character intricacies.</p>

          <p>I think the idea behind “absorb the rules and use them vigorously” is that system matters and when you understand and engage fully with the rules piece, everyone is more likely to have interesting fun. I totally agree that this isn’t essential, and many rules sets (or no rules set at all) get out of the way gracefully, but if the game asks you to understand it, understanding it leads to better outcomes.</p>

          <p>These may have been here already and I missed them, but things I love:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address your character actions to everybody at the table, not just the GM / MC. (I like to visualize this as, “speaking to the center of the table.”)</li>
<li>Make sure every player gets a chance to have their character determine the main “approach” to a problem, and when they do, look for ways for your character to support that instead of undermining it. (Relevant mostly for party-based games.)</li>
<li>Once your character has gotten what they need in a scene, look for “resolving actions” that will set the scene up to be closed elegantly, or make room for other characters to move the scene in a new direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, as everybody else says, supporting other characters (and their players!) is what’s all about. The MC has to be the fan of all the PCs, but the players should try to be fans of all the PCs too!</p>

          <p>This is a very context-dependent principle, but I am always thankful when another player makes a decision when the party is stuck in prevarication. This can obviously be a bad thing if it removes agency or is rather arbitrary, but even beyond the meta level of keeping things moving it can be a great part of the narrative.</p>
<p>For example, it can be entirely character-driven for 2/3 of your group to be stuck in caution, weighing each possibility and not settling on a good choice - then the more impulsive character just cuts straight through to a resolution, for better or worse.

          <p>This is such a great thread. I’ve picked up a lot from reading it, especially the aggressive muting when someone else is speaking.</p>
<p>One thought about players picking up the rules - players may not have ready access whether due to money or another factor. I had to order Monsterhearts 2 from my FLGS and it took about two weeks to arrive and cost about $20 or so. $25? Something like that. I’m aware Avery is all about access and actually has lower prices for folks who are struggling with money, but that isn’t true for, just as an example, D&amp;D.</p>

          <p><em>Monsterhearts 2</em> retails for $25, or roughly the cost of 2 movie tickets.</p>
<p>A Player’s Handbook is $50, and that’s all you need as a player.</p>
<p>For one-shots and short campaigns, pbta is great in that players really only need their Playbook and the Moves in order to participate. At some point, though, it’s absolutely true one thing I see good players do is <em>buy the game</em> if it’s something we’re going to play more than a couple of times experimentally.</p>

          <p>My friends and I are making an actual play podcast right now, so being a good player is something we’ve talked a lot about. For me good players make strong choices that advance the plot and find ways to support other players in their own goals. Something I’ve had to learn is to not be precious about my character. I think of the Monsterhearts core principles a lot but specifically: Make your character’s life not boring. I don’t always have to make the safe choice. I can make the wrong choice on purpose because it’s interesting! Failure is interesting.</p>
<p>Unrelated to play specifically, but I always appreciate if players bring snacks, offer to host the game, help schedule games.</p>
<p>I am also delighted when players do things like draw their character, write 12 pages of backstory, make a pinterest board, playlist, etc. As a storyteller, it tells me that they are excited and engaged in the world we’re creating together.</p>

          <p>I’m pretty new to this forum, and just finding some wonderful threads like this one. Great to see so much top-notch discussion of practical gaming concerns!</p>
<p>This thread has covered a lot of ground, but I’ll add one player skill (or attitude) that I find really important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you start playing a game, you examine and then learn to embody the particular stance and approach needed to play that game. (You do not simply attempt to play it the way you played some other game you have experience with in the past, in other words.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This might be a question of knowing how to interface with the game’s mechanics. It might be a question of seeing how the group handles in-character conversations, or how players face challenges.</p>
<p>Take a look at the rules, the structure, the relationships of the people involved, and the creative goals of the whole enterprise, and then play to that.</p>
<p>Sometimes it means understanding whether the game is about honest competition, screwing over your friends in order to win by any means necessary (cutthroat competition), or supporting everyone at all times. Sometimes it means mastering the rules and being able to make the right mechanical choices when your turn comes up. Sometimes it means noticing the attention to detail and doing your homework; at other times it’s noticing who looseness and creativity are valued here and letting go of your own attention to detail. Sometimes it means noticing that there’s one player at the table who always gets overlooked, and doing something about it.</p>
<p>But, in short, a good player takes in a new game and a new group and, first, observes and reads the vibe and the way it works. They do not assume that it’s just like something they played before.</p>
<p>They recognize that every combination of game-and-group takes its own form or its own ‘culture of play’, and, therefore should be played as its own particular, unique “instrument”. It may need a different “touch”, a different attitude, or a different perspective.</p>
<p>The player who recognizes the uniqueness of each game and each gaming situation and plays to its strengths is someone I am much more likely to enjoy playing with.</p>

          <p>A few larger-scale points come to mind, informed by my experiences doing improv with a wide variety of people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly read, learn and adapt to the culture of play of a particular group.</li>
<li>Show interest in learning rules, source material and/or the general craft of playing narrative games.</li>
<li>Leave your personal issues aside for the duration of play. (“Check your baggage at the door”)</li>
<li>Know what you like and don’t like and opt in or out accordingly</li>

          <p>Here are a few things I didn’t spot in this thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>Willingness to be a game master.</li>
<li>Wanting to improve what they are bad at, or at least challenge themselves in some way.</li>
<li>Brings something to the table, instead of being served by the others.</li>
<li>Don’t try too hard all the time. Sometimes it’s good to do something boring with your character or obvious.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Be into it”, as <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/maezar">@Maezar</a> mentioned cannot be stressed enough how important it is. Bring energy, because that will smear off on the others … up to a certain point anyway. See last point again. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
