<p>I struggled with a few things while writing this, however, notably the questions. After reading some of Homebrew World by <a class="mention" href="../../../external.html?link=https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jeremy_strandberg">@Jeremy_Strandberg</a>, I feel like I could have written better questions that provided a better hook. <strong>What suggestions might folks have about good questions when kicking off something like this?</strong></p>
<p>Even more so, though, I think I might have made the stakes bigger than I really should have. Once it was done, the players effectively woke up the personification of sleep, which I wrote as basically unleashing chaos - if sleep left the world, then in short order chaos would reign. <strong>How do you calibrate stakes in your games, fantastic or otherwise?</strong></p>

          <p>Fortunately, I think that establishing questions are in fact a great way to describe the stakes of a game, if written in an explicit way. For example, if your first question was, ‚ÄúWhy do you seek the sleeping god, despite knowing that waking them could unleash chaos upon the world?‚Äù Then that would make the stakes pretty clear.</p>
<p>For further advice on writing good questions, check out this blog post: <a href="../../../external.html?link=https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/establishing-questions" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/establishing-questions</a><br>
Jason sums it up as, ‚Äú1) the questions should help define or explore an existing aspect of your scenario and/or 2) the questions should take into account the broad character types your players are likely to bring to the table.‚Äù He also suggests waiting to ask these questions until after an initial action scene <em>in media res</em>, which I think is pretty interesting. How dynamic would it be if you started things off with a rough sketch of the characters and then jumped straight into a fight with some Hypnotic Guards? <em>Then</em> you can take a breather to figure out why you‚Äôre here.</p>

          <p>Here‚Äôs what I have written in Homebrew World (for those unfamiliar), and I stand by it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Establish Premise</strong><br>
Before character creation, work with the players to establish two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where they are <em>(and it should be someplace interesting and fantastic)</em>
</li>
<li>What they are doing there, in broad strokes <em>(exploring, rescuing, searching, hunting, fleeing; something exciting, adventurous, desperate)</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here‚Äôs a good level of detail: <em>‚Äúyou‚Äôre on the run from something scary, and it‚Äôs chased you into the dreaded Obsidian Forests of Yend.</em>‚Äù</p>
<p>Establish the premise before character creation so that the players can make informed choices. If we‚Äôre playing in a city besieged by undead, I probably won‚Äôt play a Ranger with the Forester background, y‚Äôknow?</p>
<p><strong>Hook Questions</strong><br>
While they make characters, formulate some hook questions. These should both assert something and prompt the players to make up details. <em>E.g. ‚ÄúWhat are you fleeing, that you were desperate enough to enter the Obsidian Forests of Yend?‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Your hook questions should establish all of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Motive</strong>: why are they here, doing this?</li>
<li>
<strong>Stakes</strong>: what‚Äôs on the line, why is it important?</li>
<li>
<strong>Dangers</strong>: what dangers do they expect to face? What do they know about them?</li>
<li>
<strong>Urgency</strong>: why shouldn‚Äôt they dawdle?</li>
<li>
<strong>Detail</strong>: what specifically are they hunting/ seeking/fleeing/fighting/etc.?</li>
<li>
<strong>Complications</strong>: what‚Äôs getting in they way, making this harder, constraining them?</li>
</ul>

          <p>So for example, the last time I ran Homebrew World, I asserted the premise:  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to get something out of the ghoul-infested catacombs of Kravenghast Manor. Make characters.‚Äù</p>
<p>They made characters: a Wizard (Fae-Touched), a Thief (Operative), and a Paladin (Paragon of Virtue). They did some intro questions‚Ä¶ the Wizard and Thief had a‚Ä¶ complicated past. The Paladin knows that the Thief is a better soul than he lets on. The Wizard thinks the Paladin has a beautiful soul (‚Äúso naive, its precious.‚Äù).</p>
<p>The I start by asking the Wizard about the <strong>goal</strong>: ‚ÄúWho or what are you seeking you need to rescue from the crypts beneath Kravenghast Manor, and why is it so important?‚Äù</p>
<p>She answered ‚ÄúUgh, my TA‚Äù (teaching assistance‚Ä¶ the player had recently escaped from academia and was maybe channeling). ‚ÄúHe stole something from my office and disappeared down the Crypts.‚Äù  What was it?  ‚ÄúOh, a hunk of starmetal. Not really sure what it does, been in my office for ages, in the back, collecting dust.‚Äù  (Of course, because the Fae Touched background means starmetal is anathema to her magic.)</p>
<p>She didn‚Äôt really answer why it was important, so I think I asked the Thief why rescuing the TA was important <em>to him</em>. He established that he was a fixer and troubleshooter for the University, and it‚Äôs bad PR and a crap ton of paperwork whenever students go missing. ‚ÄúEasier to get out. Or at least confirm he‚Äôs dead.‚Äù  This led to the Wizard and Thief deciding that their ‚Äúcomplicated past‚Äù was just decades of them working together on crap like this.</p>
<p>Lovely!  We‚Äôve got a couple PCs who seem to be largely motivated by bureaucratic nightmares, so I look for some more motive. I ask the Paladin ‚ÄúWhy did these two come to your order for help with this mission?‚Äù (Asserting that they came to him, and that he is part of an order, and he‚Äôs helping them on the mission, but asking him why.). He came up with this wonderful bit about how his order serves The Light (non-personal source of all life and hope), and that their order is charged with monitoring and containing Kravenghast Manor, which is shrouded in perpetual darkness. ‚ÄúOh, interesting! So where is the Manor, relative to the university?‚Äù  (looking for detail).</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs on campus.‚Äù</p>
<p>Delightful!  So we‚Äôve got an old, dilapidated sprawling manor with its own necropolis, constantly shrouded in night, on a hill in the middle of the pre-eminent University in the world.</p>
<p>I still feel like we need a little more <em>danger</em> so I ask the Paladin: ‚ÄúWhy has your order been so worried about the Manor recently? What‚Äôs changed?‚Äù  (Asserting that they‚Äôre worried, there‚Äôs something wrong, but I don‚Äôt know what.)  ‚ÄúOh, the pillar of darkness that enshrouds the place?  It‚Äôs been growing. Quickly.‚Äù  Ooh, nice. I think he threw something in about a prophecy re: a force of primordial darkness breaking loose. ‚ÄúSo, when the Wizard and the Thief showed up, looking for someone from your order to help, why‚Äôd they pick you?‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm the only true believer here, and everyone else is like HAVE AT IT, KID.‚Äù</p>
<p>I want another complication and a little more urgency, so I asked the Thief ‚ÄúWho else have you heard is here, looking for this missing TA? Or at least the starmetal artififact? And why is it so important that you find them first?‚Äù  (Asserting another interesting party is in the dungeon, and that this is a bit of a race!)  He answers that it‚Äôs a rival agent from another university, a guy he‚Äôs crossed paths with before and who never hesitates to put lives in danger. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ unprofessional.‚Äù</p>
<p>Finally, I want a little more information about the Fae-touched Wizard professor, so I ask her what her studies focus on and how this starmetal artifact is related to them. ‚ÄúWell, I study portals. And this thing is like a key. But it was just shoved in the back of my office because my magic can‚Äôt do anything with it‚Äù</p>
<p>OH REALLY?  A KEY?  AND PORTALS?  And a PROPHECY about some great DARKNESS being RELEASED?</p>
<p>And from there the adventure almost runs itself.</p>
<p>I guess my point is: making sure to ask questions that establish motive, stakes, dangers, urgency, details, and complications‚Ä¶ these all make sure that your story has a lot of hard edges for creativity to crystalize on. And by making assertions while you also ask questions, you give the players hard edges for <em>their</em> creativity to crystalize on while they answer‚Äìand at the same time, you‚Äôre putting your thumb on scale and push their answers into things that are on-theme, or that introduce new themes, or that are at least sufficiently significant.</p>
<p>How, exactly, do you know what to assert and what to ask for?  I have no idea. I think if you‚Äôve done it enough or have a natural talent for it, you do know instinctively what will work and what won‚Äôt. But every time I‚Äôve thought about how to proceduralize it, I‚Äôve stalled out.</p>
