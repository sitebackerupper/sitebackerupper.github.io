              <p><em>TL;DR:</em><br>
<em>Bryan reads, and talks about what he loves in the many WoDu Hacks that he comes across…as he finds them. Come join us to nerd-out.</em></p>
<p><em>What? WHY?</em><br>
Okay, so I’m not new here so much as I am a major lurker. I have admired the Gauntlet from afar since the G+ days, and eventually came here because members of the community like <a class="mention" href="/u/yochaigal">@yochaigal</a> have created a lot of great discussion around WoDu (World of Dungeons 1979), and DW (Dungeon World) … how to GM very light systems, how to Old School your non-D&amp;D games…all topics that are dear to my heart.</p>
<p>As I was reading, <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/how-do-you-play-world-of-dungeons/">one of the many WoDu topics</a> i’ve bookmarked, I got super hype and started typing an enthusiastic response to one of the linked WoDu hack documents…at about the 2 paragraph mark I started to feel guilty…I felt like I was swinging way OT, and just nerding out about the design of the hack I’d just started reading…and now I’m here…starting a thread where I can just…read and respond to each WoDu I find as I come across it.</p>
<p>It’s like a “let’s read” and we can just be safe and lose our shit over how fun running hacking this game is.<br>
Welcome! Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of four sessions of <a href="https://bite-marks.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders" rel="nofollow noopener">Bite Marks</a> by Becky Annison of <a href="https://blackarmada.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Black Armada Games</a>. Bite Marks is a game in which you play a pack of werewolves who must maintain the balance between man and wolf, manage the deep and sometimes messy relationships within the pack, and still stand strong against their foes. Unless the video chat landscape changes between now and the game, we will probably play using the <a href="https://meet.jit.si/" rel="nofollow noopener">Jitsi</a> browser-based chat tool. With the consent of all involved, this game will be recorded and later uploaded to Youtube.</p>
<p>It’s 1971, and in the industrial North of England the mod scene is morphing into the music and fashion movement that will be known as Northern Soul. Frequently unlicensed clubs in the factory towns and cities feature so-called “DJs”, who use new dual-turntable techniques to keep the sound of Motown flowing all night long. The working men and women seek release from the drudgery of their day-to-day lives in music, exuberant dancing, and the amphetamines that help them keep going all night long. Huntersley is a village to the North of Sheffield, the Steel City, the boundary between the heavily industrialised Don Valley and the farmlands outside. And the wolfpack who live there are also caught between two worlds. The duties and obligations of their mundane lives, and the nights when they can run free as wolves. But which will be the greater threat - the crushing inevitability of modernity, or the old secrets that dwell in the dark?</p>
<p>Content Warning: This game will almost certainly feature violent content, and probably consensual sexual content. The game also deals with ideas of social domination, and loss of personal control. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html" rel="nofollow noopener">the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy</a> and the safety tools <a href="http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m" rel="nofollow noopener">Script Change</a> and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg" rel="nofollow noopener">X-Card</a> will be in use.</p>

              <p>I’ve been obsessing over HBO’s Watchmen lately, and it has me thinking about whether or not there’s any way to capture the spirit of the show/book’s storytelling in the RPG space.</p>
<p>I’m thinking less about the story’s specific themes (deconstructing superheroes, who wields power and how?, etc.) and more about the <em>style</em> of storytelling. The way both the book and the show utilize recurring motifs and symbols, information density, rewarding worldbuilding, and clever/intentional structure. It gets my brain whirring in all sorts of interesting ways. And I’m wondering if it’s possible to capture that energy in a ttrpg.</p>
<p>My instinct is: <em>No.</em> Game stories are almost by definition looser than something like Watchmen, and games’ strengths are almost entirely antithetical to this kind of storytelling.</p>
<p>But… can it be done? If so, how would you handle it? Are there games that already exist that scratch this itch for you?</p>
<p>And I guess one more question: If Watchmen the comic was designed specifically to be a COMIC and utilize that medium’s strengths while exploring its possibilities, and Watchmen the show is doing the same for TV… what would be the game version?</p>

With this being NaNoWriMo and the holidays coming up, I’ve decided to present a greatest “Age of Ravens” hits for the next several weeks. To that end, I’m presenting the first installment of each of my History of RPG Genre posts, along with links to the reset of the series. I start in the wastelands of Post-Apocalyptic RPGs today with 1978’s <em>Metamorphosis Alpha</em> (the first game I played after D&amp;D).<br>

              <p>Due to the recent announcement of Diablo 4, I’ve been on a whole dungeon crawl action RPG kinda kick, and while I was playing one I had a bit of a realization:</p>
<p>The whole premise of that genre of videogame seems in one way to be <em>classic</em> D&amp;D. It’s <em>all</em> about dungeon delving and getting tons of loot and treasure. But the way it happens is that you get just <em>dozens and hundreds</em> of pieces of gear dropping as you kill things and open chests, mostly randomly generated, which you then ritually sort through once you get back to town, in order to see what few items you might actually keep, and sell off the rest.</p>
<p>Despite this ostensibly being a very classic dungeon crawling type of fantasy, the on-the-fly generation of hundreds of pieces of loot seems like something that only really took off once you could get a computer to do that in the background for you.</p>
<p>Anyway, that contrast between this classic TTRPG premise and how much it relies on being a videogame and using background algorithms to actually work made me wonder, could you simulate the experience of a game like Diablo, Torchlight, Destiny, etc. in a TTRPG? Have any tabletop games done something similar? Could you do it in a way that’s actually any fun?</p>
<p>My very first thought would be to have just big ol tables that you roll on and combine the results of, like [Cuirass, Buckler, Helm, Greaves, Sword, Axe, Mace…] + [of the Hawk, of the Templar, of the Revenant, of Strength, of Fire Resistance…] etc. etc. Since it’d bog the game WAY down in play, maybe you just get generic “unopened” loot while you’re dungeon delving, and there’s some sort of post-game phase where you roll it all up and see what you get? I’ve seen plenty of tables for like “If your players search the giant’s pockets, roll on this to see what random junk he has,” but this seems a little different.</p>

<p>We just launched the kickstarter to pre-sell badges. If you’re interested in these kinds of games and are in the southwest US, I hope you give it a look and consider joining us in April!</p>
<p>We have backing tiers for a badge, a badge and a hotel room, and just a support tier if you can’t attend but want to help us out.</p>

          <title>Seeking brevity readers for QUARREL AND FABLE quickstart</title>

            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Quarrel and Fable</strong> <em>is my British OSR game that’s been out for a couple of years now, hearkening back to the UK gamebook craze of the fin de siecle.  The digital rules are forever free, but I’m working on a paper quickstart that’ll be a single sheet total.  This is the first draft of that — it’ll be packaged with a short wilderness module and four pregen characters.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m largely seeking input on its brevity and clarity — does this make sense from a first read, considering you’d be able to tear off and distribute some small character sheets too?</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>QUARREL AND FABLE QUICKSTART</h2>
<p>Tell stories where YOU are the hero — with only three dice, a pencil, and an eraser.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Unified resolution</h3>
<ul>
<li>To achieve an uncertain outcome in a risky situation, roll 2D6 equal to or higher than 9.  This is known as <em>Testing your Mettle</em>.</li>
<li>If you have an <em>advantage</em>, roll 3D6 and sum the highest two.  If you would gain <em>advantage</em> from multiple sources, the situation is no longer risky and you succeed without needing to roll.</li>
<li>Combat has a slight variation.  Instead of rolling to hit 9, you need to hit your target’s SKILL or higher: success means you inflict damage on them, failure means they inflict damage on you. In combat, whichever side is smaller gets to act first.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Three stat system</h3>
<ul>
<li>SKILL is a catchall measure of martial prowess.  You gain <em>advantage</em> when attacking a foe with lower SKILL than your own.</li>
<li>STAMINA dictates longevity and resilience.  Damage you take reduces your STAMINA: if it falls to 0, you fall unconscious; if it falls below 0, you die.</li>
<li>LUCK is self-explanatory.  You may spend a point of LUCK to give <em>advantage</em> to any time you <em>Test your Mettle</em>.  You can also spend <em>Special Skill</em> points in the same way, if the situation is within the remit of the skill.</li>
</ul>
<h3>No more Vancian magic</h3>
<ul>
<li>Instead of characters, players must memorise the spells by their three letter codes.  Players cannot refer to this list during play.  Players can’t cast non-existent spells: they lose D6^ STAMINA instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NAD</strong> — <em>Spend 1 STAMINA.  Thirty seconds later, one ignited source expends all of its energy in a single moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>YAD</strong> — <em>Spend D6v STAMINA.  Push one creature three feet in any direction.</em></p>
<p><strong>YIP</strong> — <em>Spend D6v STAMINA.  Summon the shadow of a small dog that lasts until the next dawn.  It loudly barks at unfamiliar people or strange smells.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>D6v is the lowest of 2D6; D6^ is the highest of 2D6</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ve won your revolution. What will you do with freedom? After occupation and revolution, your nation is finally free. Now you need to decide what happens next. Will you work with your fellow citizens to build a glorious new land, or forge your own path?<br>
In <em>Free From the Yoke,</em> you’ll control one of 8 different Houses. These are the factions that define your new country, and through their struggles and fortunes you’ll tell your fledgling nation’s history.<br>
You’ll also play a viewpoint Character from your House, however. Their adventures and sagas, their brushes with the supernatural and their desperate struggle on the battlefield, will help guide the course of history.<br>
Finally, there’s the Arbiter – the organisation in control of this land. They might be the heroes of the revolutionary war, avatars of the Land itself risen up to oust the Empire, or even a governor left here by the Empire as part of their peace treaty with you. Their playbook tells you what sort of challenges they’ll force onto their subjects, what laws they’ll enforce, and how your Houses and Characters can exploit their organisation to their advantage. The Arbiter also has an Agent, a powerful free agent to add into your mix when characters go on adventures, and Projects – map-changing ambitions that will define each age of your saga.</p>
<p>This is the first month of the first quarter of a year-long campaign of <a href="https://ufopress.co.uk/product/free-from-the-yoke/" rel="nofollow noopener">Free from the Yoke</a> by Jay Iles and Fyodor Kasatkin. The sessions will be scheduled month-to-month in quarterly blocks.<br>
However, <strong>the Houses in play will be determined in the first session and will not change</strong> (barring narrative).<br>
Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must sign up for each session you wish to attend. When a new player joins, they will take over the House of the previous player.</p>
<p>We’ll use <a>Google Hangouts</a>. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links.</p>
<p>Safety Tools: We will use <a href="https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change" rel="nofollow noopener">Script Change</a> and <a href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean#30913" rel="nofollow noopener">Lines and Veils</a> during our sessions. We will observe the <a href="http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy</a>.</p>

              <p>I am working on a light sci-fi pbta game. I’ve notice that when players use the combat move (Blast 'em!) they sometimes struggle to figure out what to spend an extra hold on. Here is the move as it currently stands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Blast ‘em!:</strong> When you try to use violence to solve a problem, roll +Swashbuckling.</p>
<p>10+ Inflict one damage and pick two. 7-9 - Inflict one damage and pick one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid return fire (Costs 2)</li>
<li>Do extra damage (Costs 2)</li>
<li>Damage something critical</li>
<li>Be extremely precise</li>
<li>Give an advantage to a teammate. They gain one plot armor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Extra damage and avoiding return fire have to cost 2 holds because of how my health system works.</p>
<p>I am looking for more interesting options to add to the list. I will probably add this as a one-hold option:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily pin an enemy in place</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I am looking for other suggestions. The tone is sci-fi serial TV.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>I’m currently collaborating on a Pokémon inspired PbtA game and I wanted to start a discussion about a particular aspect we have been working on. One of the stated design goals for this project is to encourage audience participation as part of the game, either at a convention panel or on a platform like Twitch. I wanted to probe the community about methods they’ve used to engage with an audience in any aspect, and see if anyone knows of other RPGs that have mechanics like this.</p>
<p>Some examples of what I’m talking about:</p>
<p>Embark:  when the party embarks on a long journey, the audience rolls+nothing. Result determines whether they find good things or they find trouble along the route.</p>
<p>Audience Roll + nothing<br>
The party ventures forth into regions unknown</p>
<p>10+: There is no danger and the players choose 1<br>
7-9: There is some danger and the GM chooses 1<br>
6-: There is significant danger and the GM moves</p>
<p>Choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>You find an ancient ruin of a lost civilization</li>
<li>You find evidence of a powerful pokemon</li>
<li>You discover a secret about the world</li>
<li>You find resources that can be exploited</li>
<li>You find someone in need who will pay for your help</li>
</ul>
<p>Consult the Pokedex: when the players ask a question about the world, Pokémon, or the players, someone will answer truthfully. If the question is about a player or that player’s Pokémon, they will answer. If the question is about the world, the setting, or non-party Pokémon, the audience will volunteer answers and the GM will choose their favorite.</p>
<p>Wild Encounter: At the start of the session, each member of the audience is offered a raffle ticket. When the party encounters a Pokémon in the wild, the GM pulls a raffle ticket and that audience member decides which Pokémon they run into.</p>
<p>Has anyone seen other games with mechanics like this? How would you optimize these mechanics for a convention panel? For Twitch? For non-live media like Podcasts or YouTube? Curious to hear your feedback.</p>

“It doesn’t work like that.”<br>
That’s all language that asserts (a little) “I know better” / “I’m staking our a place of opposition.”</p>
<p>In my experience anything else in the post isn’t as likely to be useful, and it’s likelier that the thread details after. So I tend to breeze past those.</p>
<p>But what can you do?</p>
<p>Why not try<br>
“I’ve had a different experience…” (And say what it is!)<br>
“Why do you think that? Are you saying (restate as you understand it)”<br>
“It works like this: (and explain)</p>
<p>I just find a little positive phrasing goes a long way to convey that I’m  being constructive.</p>

              <p>I’ve started putting out a weekly podcast dedicated to my free small press RPG. The first two episodes, available now, are dedicated to world creation and character creation for the two-player, GM-less campaign which we’ll undertake in future episodes.</p>
<p>Available at <a href="https://ironsworn.podbean.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ironsworn.podbean.com/</a>, and (hopefully) on your preferred podcast app.</p>
<p>Mad respect to all of the Gauntlet podcasters. Holy cow, is it a bunch of work.</p>

              <p>ALIEN<br>
Here are four sessions of the ALIEN role playing game by Free League Publishing. In ALIEN you play in a universe of body horror and corporate brinkmanship, where synthetic people play god while space truckers and marines serve host to newborn ghoulish creatures. It’s a harsh and unforgiving universe and you are nothing if not expendable.</p>
<p>We will be playing what Free League calls a “Cinematic Scenario”. A Cinematic scenario emulates the dramatic arc of an ALIEN film. This game mode emphasizes high stakes and fast and brutal play. Conflict between player characters is likely, and you are not all expected to survive. In fact, most of your PCs probably won’t live to see the end of the scenario. If you die you’ll just jump into the body of a NPC and keep on space trucking.</p>
<p>CONTENT WARNING: This is a survival horror game. This may not be the game for you if you are sensitive to themes of body horror, extreme violence, sudden character death, and PvP conflict. We’ll use communication and consent tools including the X-Card, Lines/Veils, and the Open Door to help everyone have a scary fun time, but please keep the contents and premise in mind.</p>
<p>Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you plan to attend. The Open Door policy will be in effect but the character you play will be active in each session. Therefore, if you miss a session, your character might be played as an NPC or by another PC. If your character dies, you will have a new character to play when you return.</p>
<p>We will use Streamyard to play. I will record and post the session to youtube if all players consent.</p>

              <p>Nick Wedig’s game Rusałka is super great and I love it: <a href="https://nickwedig.itch.io/rusalka" rel="nofollow noopener">https://nickwedig.itch.io/rusalka</a> (If you want to buy it as a deck of cards, it is also available on DTRPG: <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/273096/Rusalka" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/273096/Rusalka</a>). This is a very focused monkey’s paw of a game - you will play people who really need things, and you will also play the cruel supernatural monsters who will give them precisely what they ask for.</p>
