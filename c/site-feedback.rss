              <p>First: I’m not a mod.</p>
<p>I just notice that when someone starts a post with a negative<br>
“I don’t agree.”<br>
“That’s wrong.”<br>
“It doesn’t work like that.”<br>
That’s all language that asserts (a little) “I know better” / “I’m staking our a place of opposition.”</p>
<p>In my experience anything else in the post isn’t as likely to be useful, and it’s likelier that the thread details after. So I tend to breeze past those.</p>
<p>But what can you do?</p>
<p>Why not try<br>
“I’ve had a different experience…” (And say what it is!)<br>
“Why do you think that? Are you saying (restate as you understand it)”<br>
“It works like this: (and explain)</p>
<p>I just find a little positive phrasing goes a long way to convey that I’m  being constructive.</p>

<p>Would a section of the forum where we can posts compiled lists of games series by system be of interest to folk?</p>
<p>(eg, having a threat for Monsterhearts, a thread for World Wide Wrestling, a thread for Hearts of Wulin ect)</p>
<p>that way if somebody wants to look for actual plays of a specific games, we have them listed in a easy to find format.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>A few suggestions for making your posts awesome:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be considerate of other people’s time/energy/effort. People are more likely to be willing to be generous with what they know when you have shown that you have done the same. If you have a question, give some context. Tell us a bit about what you know already about the subject, etc. (Related: search for topics before creating a new one - there might already exist a thread discussing exactly what you want to discuss. (Feel free to add to it!))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you just read an article that you think would create a great discussion, post the link and tell us all about the thoughts it has brought to mind for you and how they relate to gaming. Others will follow suit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have recently been seeing hype about a new game, tell us what you know so far. Tell us what it is that really has you interested in finding out more about it and what it is that makes you want to play it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have designed something and you would like some feedback on what you have so far: tell us as much as you can about what you are doing. What are you trying to accomplish? Are there any unusual mechanics you’ve created? Is it based on any other games or frameworks? If so, what lead you to do that? Is there something in particular you are looking for feedback on? Why that particular thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using initialisms/acronyms (DitV, DW, CATS, etc.) or jargon (Lines &amp; Veils, roll under system, etc.) - please explain (or link to an explanation) of those things as you use them. Don’t alienate readers or force them to go do Google searches just to understand your post. You’ll lose them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please, no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_take" rel="nofollow noopener">hot takes</a>. You have all the time in the world to craft your post. There is no deadline. The discussion will still be there twelve hours from now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take all the time you need to compose your post. It will be more measured, more deliberate, more thought provoking, and likely have fewer typos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We appreciate positive feedback here, so if you want to say “Thanks” or show that you liked someone’s post, just click the little heart to give them some love! It helps keep the conversation flowing and avoids clutter. (Also, feel free to PM the author if you want to say more!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please do not recruit for non-Gauntlet Hangouts games or other online/IRL gaming groups.</p>
</li>
</ul>

              <p>Hi! I don’t know if this is the kind of thing you can fix, but, here’s are some steps to reproduce a minor bug:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/ewillisson/preferences/account">https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/ewillisson/preferences/account</a>
</li>
<li>Click on the “Profile” link</li>
<li>Click on the “Email” link or any other link in that column</li>
</ol>
<p>Expected behavior: The content changes to preferences relating to the clicked label<br>
Actual: It keeps showing the “Profile” content, but the URL changes.</p>
<p>I’m able to fix it and start seeing different Preferences pages again by reloading, when there’s a different URL shown (like <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/ewillisson/preferences/emails">https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/ewillisson/preferences/emails</a>)</p>
<p>This is on ChromeOS Version 72.0.3626.122 (Official Build) (32-bit)</p>
<p>This definitely isn’t a large problem, but it was surprising, so I wanted to document it.</p>
<p>I just noticed there’s a stack trace in the JavaScript that shows up when I first reproduce this bug. Here it is:</p>

              <p>Hi! I asked this question a few days back, likely in the wrong place, because I’m not sure where it belongs.</p>
<p>Is there, or should there be, a category/topic for people to post opportunities to run games IRL? I know LFP posts are off-limits, but this is not that. I run a convention which tries to be Gauntlet-friendly, and certainly promotes indie games wherever possible. I’d love to be able to invite people to run games at our tables, but don’t want to spam or put promo where it’s not wanted, because I like clean forums.</p>

              <p>With all the abbreviations floating around it might be useful to have support for abbreviation explanation tooltips—especially for new users. Kind of like the list in the Gauntlet Jargon document.</p>
<p>Example: <abbr title="Dungeon World">DW</abbr></p>
<p>I know this can be done by manually using the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> tag but I saw that there’s a relevant <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/add-abbr-tags-to-words-in-posts/88394" rel="nofollow noopener">discourse plugin</a> which makes it more user-friendly. I’m not sure about the quality of the plugin and how you feel about installing plugins, but I thought I would throw the idea over your way <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=6" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>I believe I know why that rule is in place, too keep discussions from being taken out of context, but it might be worth clarifying what ideas/words can be used outside the forums.  Specifically,  I was thinking about what goes on in the game design category.  The Ziggurratti thread made me stop and think about the copying restriction and how theoretically it might limit such discussions, as people realize they may not be able to use that text to actually develop the game.  Thoughts?</p>

              <p>Is there a standard SOP (standard operating procedure) the mods are using when interacting with folx? I think it’d be helpful to see the approach to a problem, a list of mods. I assume there’s some guidelines for each one that they’re held accountable to. Something that tells members when you should be flagging something and what falls into general discourse or disagreement would also be helpful.</p>
<p>I looked around a bit but didn’t see that. I’d appreciate being pointed to it if it already exists. If people are messaged this on joining it would be helpful as well, I bet.</p>

              <p>In the descriptions of the trust levels, it is unclear if you need to meet <em>either one</em> or <em>all</em> of the conditions listed.<br>
I guess it must be all conditions, right? Otherwise I’d already be member (which is only possible after 15 days).<br>
It would really help to mention this specifically.</p>
<p>I’m also unclear about the varies badges. If they are  nothing but “participation trophies”, I would prefer sticking to things that are truly empowering like the trust levels.<br>
Anything else just clutters my notifications (esp. in the beginning) and personally I don’t feel like I need a gamified incentive to participate.</p>
<p>Other than that I’m really excited to see a forum grow  next to the Slack!</p>

              <p>So I’m not super jazzed about the profile window that tells us everything we’ve done and how it’s doing with other people. Personal preference or legitimate concern? Je ne sais pas.</p>
<p>I would like a page, though, where you could pin things you want to save, which is kind of how I force the DM-yourself part of Slack to work for me . . . <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=6" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

              <p>Hi, I have a question: What does the “Flag” thing do? Does this send a message to mods or admins to flag content that may be critical? Or is this like a bookmark?</p>
<p>Weird. For testing purposes, I decided to flag this post, and learned that yes, it was a message to the mods.</p>
<p>When trying to send it, I received the message that I had reached the maximum number of new topics a new user can create and that I should wait 42 minutes. Does flagging count as “Creating a topic”?</p>

              <p>I want to keep discussion focused. If we see lots of discussion around something regularly and it looks like it would make a good category then we can look into that. But atm I think less is more.</p>
<p>I specifically also want to nudge people to thread all the discussion about posted Hangouts games.</p>
