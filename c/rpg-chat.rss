              <p><em>TL;DR:</em><br>

<p><em>What? WHY?</em><br>
Okay, so I’m not new here so much as I am a major lurker. I have admired the Gauntlet from afar since the G+ days, and eventually came here because members of the community like <a class="mention" href="/u/yochaigal">@yochaigal</a> have created a lot of great discussion around WoDu (World of Dungeons 1979), and DW (Dungeon World) … how to GM very light systems, how to Old School your non-D&amp;D games…all topics that are dear to my heart.</p>
<p>As I was reading, <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/how-do-you-play-world-of-dungeons/">one of the many WoDu topics</a> i’ve bookmarked, I got super hype and started typing an enthusiastic response to one of the linked WoDu hack documents…at about the 2 paragraph mark I started to feel guilty…I felt like I was swinging way OT, and just nerding out about the design of the hack I’d just started reading…and now I’m here…starting a thread where I can just…read and respond to each WoDu I find as I come across it.</p>
<p>It’s like a “let’s read” and we can just be safe and lose our shit over how fun running hacking this game is.<br>
Welcome! Thanks for reading!</p>

              <p>I’ve been obsessing over HBO’s Watchmen lately, and it has me thinking about whether or not there’s any way to capture the spirit of the show/book’s storytelling in the RPG space.</p>
<p>I’m thinking less about the story’s specific themes (deconstructing superheroes, who wields power and how?, etc.) and more about the <em>style</em> of storytelling. The way both the book and the show utilize recurring motifs and symbols, information density, rewarding worldbuilding, and clever/intentional structure. It gets my brain whirring in all sorts of interesting ways. And I’m wondering if it’s possible to capture that energy in a ttrpg.</p>
<p>My instinct is: <em>No.</em> Game stories are almost by definition looser than something like Watchmen, and games’ strengths are almost entirely antithetical to this kind of storytelling.</p>
<p>But… can it be done? If so, how would you handle it? Are there games that already exist that scratch this itch for you?</p>
<p>And I guess one more question: If Watchmen the comic was designed specifically to be a COMIC and utilize that medium’s strengths while exploring its possibilities, and Watchmen the show is doing the same for TV… what would be the game version?</p>

              <p>What do you do as MC when your players wonder into PvP territory? (assume they want it and they are on board with it)</p>
<p>Its easy when they fight over something - they are triggering moves and the other can interfere.</p>
<p>It gets more difficult when they are talking. My players are kind of talky types and they talk and ask each other questions then take decision, yes I’ll do it or no I won’t.<br>
<strong>At what point should I call for moves? or should I just sit and wait until they seem to hit a wall and cannot agree on what should happen next and then call for moves?</strong></p>
<p>Situation from my last game of Apocalypse World. Players were talking and talking, exchanging arguments and when they drive to a wall they wanted to read the other person with only intent to ask “how can I get you to …” and then do/say that.<br>
I find it dull and boring resolution. Yes it gives the other player opportunity to set price as high as he wants, but on the other hand it forces them to comply, they cannot refuse once they said how to convince them.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>

              <p>I am on the 3rd session tonight of a DungeonWorld game using my own homebrew campaign setting.  When I prepare for a game for both DnD and DungeonWorld I write up a group of possible hooks, events and plans for the story based on the setting and basically an ideas prompt sheet.  I don’t usually pick monsters or stats and instead let the events sort of drive out what might happen, although sometimes I might have a specific monster in mind.</p>
<p>It works really well for me as a GM and I will sometimes share progress if the characters work through it. If ideas and things during a game go a different direction I will add them in between sessions to reflect the changing events.  I usually add a lot of links and organisations to the different characters, because it feels right that most folk / NPC’s they meet will be part of something bigger and where possible it helps me feel like I am developing a solid story/environment. At its very least level of use I do get a quick reference to NPC names…</p>
<p>I use free Google Draw to create the links and ideas from the characters.  If anyone is interested I can share a copy of this drawing in on google and you can copy to edit your own versions.  Sample attached.</p>

              <p>I have tried on and off to run various powered by the apocalypse games. And it’s something I’d like to do more of in the future. I mostly play OSR games and find I often approach running PbtA games with that mindset and it doesn’t quite work. Or it feels like I am doing something backwards.</p>
<p>I was wondering if people thought this characterization of the difference in how the games should be run is apt:</p>
<p><strong>OSR</strong>: you are in this situation and you do something clever, so don’t roll the dice. Good job!<br>
<strong>PbtA</strong>: you are in this situation (the game cares about) and you rolled well so you did something clever—what was it? Good job!</p>
<p>And, I guess some corollary to this would be clever play in PbtA games would be about managing when you do or don’t trigger moves in the game.</p>
<p>Or should I be thinking about this is a totally different way? (!!)</p>

              <p>I’m planning a three day Long Con of Mouse Guard: we’ll be playing a series of Mouse Guard sessions back to back with the same crew over the course of a long weekend. I’m not sure how many sessions we’ll have time to do, but I wanted to have a lot of material to draw from, since I won’t have much time to prep between sessions.</p>
<p>I drafted an outline for the missions (two per season) and I’d be interested in any feedback. My goal was to create a variety of missions that have an overarching premise: something that would feel cohesive but not repetitive. In play, I imagine these missions will change quite a bit based on the beliefs and goals of the Guard mice, but I also don’t want to have to rely completely on improvised stakes.</p>
<p>I also wanted to choose missions that would leave a lot of loose ends to potentially be resolved in the player turn. Most of the missions are defensive and logistical. If the patrol want to try to win back lost territories, they have to try that on their own time.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>

              <p>If I wanted to pickpocket a player here are some thoughts I would appreciate input on.</p>
<ol>
<li>Should I be very sneaky and make a suggestion that a small halfling bumps into you and heads off in the crowd. Then it is up to the player to make a move with a possible discern realities roll.  If they don’t decide to make a move I have been lucky and got away with an item from about their person.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note on option 1. Would you consider rolling back time a bit. Lets say the player succeeds on a discern reality. Should I then say it looks like the Halfing snagged a pouch from you and therefore they get to react to the theft before the halfling cuts the purse? So a sort of premonition type roll after the event to change the outcome before it happens?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Should I be a little more fair and start with something like “its crowded in this market area of town and various people are pushing up against you including a small halfling”.  In this situation it is before any action is taken. Perhaps I could then say “in the corner of your eye you think the halfing is getting a bit closer to you than necessary to cut through the crowd”.   At which point I have put the situation on a plate for them in regard to the potential for reacting to the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I make it super blatant. You are in the crowd by the abbey entrance and a halfling reaches out to snip your pouch away, what do you do?  This one is clearly an opportunity for the player to make a possible Defy Danger move to avoid the pick pocket, however it feels a little obvious to tell the player they are being robbed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any thoughts and how you like to handle a stealthy type tactics against the players, whilst giving them a chance to react with a move would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

              <p>I’m interested in finding some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction" rel="nofollow noopener">hard science fiction</a> games set in space. That is, games where the science is reasonably accurate: no magic, no FTL, etc. In terms of fictional touchpoints, think “Gravity” and “The Martian” or, at the very outside, “2001: A Space Odyssey”. I’m not super concerned at the moment with the ‘mechanical genre’, as it were, whether it’s PbtA or traditional or something else entirely.</p>
<p>While I’ve played (and enjoyed) other science fiction games, this is a really specific itch that things like Traveller and Scum &amp; Villainy don’t quite scratch. Thoughts / suggestions / pointers welcome.</p>

              <p>Today I saw a rumour tweeted by <a href="http://twitter.com/randomdnd" rel="nofollow noopener">@randomdnd</a>, and immediately thought it would make a fantastic stepping off for a single session of <strong>Dungeon World</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You lose her near a desolate prison flooded with giant chuul. The hag said that the Dream Shard of Death was fought here. <span class="hashtag">#dnd</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>What are you doing?</em></p>
<p>From here, you can extrapolate the ambiguities in the hook to generate some compost for the game.  If you have a D6 closer to hand than a playgroup, use these instead:</p>
<h4>Who is <em>she</em>?</h4>
<ul>
<li>1-3: a master ironmonger</li>
<li>4-5: the hag</li>
<li>6: a pregnant duchess</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lose her?</h4>
<ul>
<li>1-3: Lost her trail</li>
<li>4-5: Escaped her chase</li>
<li>6: She died</li>
</ul>
<h4>What caused the desolation?</h4>
<ul>
<li>1-3: Dragonfire</li>
<li>4-5: Plague</li>
<li>6: Geostationary comet</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who was imprisoned?</h4>
<ul>
<li>1-3: War criminals</li>
<li>4-5: Heretic scholars</li>
<li>6: A nascent godling</li>
</ul>
<h4>The hag?</h4>
<ul>
<li>1-3: Grendeldam, mother of trolls</li>
<li>4-5: An accursed warlock</li>
<li>6: Terrestrial boneless lamprey</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Dream Shard of Death?</h4>
<ul>
<li>1-3: A sentient glaive</li>
<li>4-5: An historic troupe of would-be heroes</li>
<li>6: A gestalt anthropocorpus</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fought…</h4>
<ul>
<li>1-3: And slain</li>
<li>4-5: And fled</li>
<li>6: But never bested</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do you have some grim portents?</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Just use a couple of small <em>clocks</em> and extrapolate from whichever thread isn’t being directly addressed right now.</p>

              <p>Hello!<br>
I have started putting together some incursions for Trophy Gold. While I think the text itself lays out what is needed <em>mechanically</em>, it is focused on conversions rather than original work. That suggests a situation where there is an original text to reference for details and flavor and meta narrative.<br>
I’ve been writing and running adventures for a while, and I have ideas on how to integrate those elements into a specifically Trophy Gold context.<br>
Where I’m struggling, a bit, is the map/flowchart thing. I very much like Trophy Gold taking away the square by square crawl and making it more narrative. But - and it is only the case sometimes - the map can be a major element of design and mood, and flowcharts mostly bring a mood of loathing. I haven’t really settled on a more evocative way to do it, and, maybe in a way that brings design into it. If all of you tinkerers and magicians have any ideas on how to enliven them, I would most appreciate hearing them.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>One of the sessions I want to run is a giant chase, where the players feel pressured to keep moving, and that if they sit around or turtle up they will be much more in harms way than if they keep moving. There will be opportunity for occasional interludes of peace, but by and large I want the bulk of the 4 - 5 hours to be an adrenaline filled race. I want them to overcome hazards as creatively as they can, while trying to get at least one of their team to the destination with the McGuffin.</p>
<p>In true Dungeon World style I’m going to have the PCs contribute some of the hazards they can potentially encounter or work to avoid.</p>
<p>What tips do you have for running good chase scenes?<br>
What game systems do chase scenes well?</p>

<p>The actual con’s physical setting is at a summer camp set in the mountains behind Los Angeles. It is at the foot of a huge mountain nestled in national forest land.</p>
<p>Wonder if anyone has any suggestions for a LARP that can be played in the wilderness?</p>
<p>I’m thinking of hiking out a ways away from the camp, and then larping it up.</p>
<p>And while I could spend hours searching on Google, I felt that the erudite and accomplished (not to mention good-looking) folks of the Gauntlet may have some thoughts.</p>

          <title>Tower of the Compass Rose - A Convention Campaign</title>

              <p>Next March my buddy/coworker and I are hosting ShushCon, a convention at my library. To help advertise our event we are going to another convention (SCARAB) to run some games.  We’ve decide to set all of our scenarios in the same setting, one we created using Microscope. Normally I’d have a loose outline and really let the players shape everything about the game but because I’m collaborating with another GM that won’t work.  (A previous year I chained together four sessions based on home-made dungeon starters and it went very well.)</p>
<p>Working with another GM really makes this is a much more stressful experience, and I can only imagine how the on-site event  will wind-up my co-GM, he’s a bit more tightly strung than I am.</p>
<p>We are currently planning 8 sessions, alternating GMs, to run in sequential time-blocks. There are two time blocks on the last day of the con that we aren’t running anything, but who knows we may add some in. The premise of this campaign is that it covers the life of an artifact the Compass Rose, which changed the world on which it was created, both by it’s coming into being and by it’s destruction at the end.</p>
<p>Some of the scenarios are close together in time, but others have huge jumps in time in between them. Players can play in all of them, or drop/out between sessions without messing with the story. In the campaign the players place and activate the compass rose, an artifact that prevents demons from entering this sphere of reality. (Lots of demons come here because the world is the body of a dead god.)  Things happen, a tower gets built, the power of the Compass Rose expands as it is enshrined.  Bad guy takes over the tower, players stop his plot then recapture the tower. Eventually even the benevolent spirits who have come to this world start to go crazy. At the end, the players get to play a strike force from an alliance of elves and serpent men who are tasked with breaking the Compass Rose before it destroys the world.</p>
<p>After the first session, we will build up a town and huge tower on the table, using both handcrafted and 3d printed buildings. Each session will see the town grown and the environs will change. (We are about to start building a modular tower that is about a foot and a half across).</p>
<p>I had some questions when I started typing this, but now I just wonder if we aren’t a bit crazy to do this.</p>

              <p>So this is kind of a weird topic, but… For a long time I’ve been seeing how <em>Blades in the Dark,</em> and then <em>Forged in the Dark,</em> have really been taking off in the PbtA-adjacent, indie gaming world. There have been a number of hacks and new games coming out that look <em>really</em> interesting! <em>Song for the Dusk, Scum and Villainy, Blades Against Darkness, A Nocturne, Hack the Planet, Band of Blades, Beam Saber,</em> etc… I’ve enjoyed checking all these out, especially the really evocative settings that most of them come with, buuuut…</p>
<p>Having played a few times, and watched/listened to a number of actual plays, I still just can’t get into the system… In theory, I enjoy how there’s generally a little more going on than in your average PbtA game: deeper avenues for advancement, lots of currencies to manage, etc. But, there’s a number of things that I just constantly bounce off of.</p>
<p>I’ll try to refrain from writing out a whole exhaustive list, but in brief, the big things that come to mind are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can’t ever quite get my head around Position/Effect. It feels like it can really slow the game down to declare/negotiate these every move, and I never feel like I have a solid sense of what different levels of effect are supposed to look like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default harshness of the system also puts me off. If you take harm, it’s pretty difficult to ever get rid of. Stress seems designed to build up on you over time no matter how much you keep it down. PC mortality seems high, because the crew is the only real lasting character. Doing jobs against higher tier factions puts you at near-constant limited effect, etc. I guess this is a personal taste thing at the end of the day… I’ve thought about how you could house-rule some of these things, but at what point does modifying rules for a game start to feel like “just play something else…?”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I absolutely don’t mean this to be a post dragging FitD. When I look at it from a more detached design standpoint, it’s a really brilliant system. I think it’s a great example of every mechanic and currency tying in really tightly with one another, and so much has been written already about the great setting in <em>Blades</em>. It’s just that for me, it’s still not clicking. But I really <em>want</em> it to click!</p>
<p>TLDR; what advice do people have for me to find a way to really <em>get</em> Blades/FitD? Is there a good mentality to adopt that might make it work for me? I guess at some point it becomes a matter of “it’s just not for you,” but I’m still at the stage of hoping that’s not the case. How do you suggest easing into it? Are there home rules people have used to make it work for them?</p>
<p>Edit: On top of that, feel free to tell me what you really like about Blades/FitD! I’d love to hear what people are enthusiastic about with this system! Maybe it’d help to hear what about it makes people really excited!</p>

              <p>This might be weird to say on the Gauntlet, given the nature of the business, but I think there are people drawn here for reasons other than the hangouts, and regardless, I think it’s interesting to discuss perhaps the different gaming experience provided by one-shorts vs more campaign oriented games. In particular, I’m curious if anyone else believes that the popularity of one-shots has skewed in anyway the direction that new games in the PbtA-verse are taking.</p>
<p>I’ve played a number of one-shots in various systems, and I mean, it’s not bad! But I find that knowing things will end produces a very different type of gaming experience. It’s not bad per se, just different…people can really lean into the drama, make destructive decisions (not trolling, just you know, dramatic), can really just push hard on the system. The downside is, well, that in my experience sometimes that can get out of hand, or just sort of get a bit ham-fisted in a way that I personally don’t enjoy. With more campaign oriented play people are encouraged to get more invested in the longer-term arc of their character, which I personally enjoy quite a bit.</p>
<p>Obviously logistically, one-shots are great. They’re great for people who struggle to play regularly, and they’re great for game designers, since it’s much easier to test in a bunch of one shots than in a bunch of campaigns. Take Hearts of Wulin, for example. I’m really excited about seeing the full rule book whenever it drops, but I can’t help but be worried that it’s optimized for a 1-3 session experience because that’s where the bulk of the playtesting was. I’m curious if anyone else has any thoughts on how the feedback loop might influence designs. For example, in the “crunchy systems” thread, people discussed character advancement a little bit. One complaint I’ve seen levied against PbtA games in general on other forums is that advancement isn’t that excited…this could be an outgrowth of one-shot culture, because in that case, advancement isn’t super common like it is vs in a game specifically oriented around campaigns.</p>
<p>And of course, the discussion about one-shots goes way beyond PbtA of course, those games just happen to be popular and pretty fleshed out. A lot of the game design that happens at least that I see on Twitter etc is for very short games…200 word games, 1 page games, and so on. I personally find these games clever as an intellectual endeavor, but hard to get invested in.</p>
<p>I just want to caveat:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m not saying pbta is bad</li>
<li>I’m not saying you can’t play a campaigns in pbta</li>
<li>I’m not saying nobody plays campaigns</li>
<li>I’m not saying character advancement is non-existent in pbta</li>
<li>I’m not saying game creators don’t consider campaigns at all (though for 200 word games etc I think many do not)</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m just discussing where people might fall on the one-shot/campaign spectrum, and discussing whether or not these preferences have influenced game design in our milieu.</p>

The Gauntlet community plays tons of RPGs that are Powered by the Apocalypse (Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, Monsterhearts, and Masks A New Generation, to name a few). While each game has its own distinct rules and approaches, there are enough commonalities within the Apocalypse Engine to develop a toolbox to cover the core assumptions in PbtA RPGs. This panel will cover techniques for GMing PbtA games (or MCing them, if you prefer).</p>
<p>Our Panelists:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Marissa “MK” Kelly</strong> from Magpie Games, renowned con GM and award-winning designer of Epyllion and Bluebeard’s Bride, and more</li>
<li>
<strong>Phil Vecchione</strong> from Encoded Designs, one of the original Gnome Stew authors, co-host of the Misdirected Mark and She’s a Super Geek podcasts, and designer of Hydro Hackers along with other RPGs</li>
<li>
<strong>Rach Shelkey</strong>, con organizer, MCing pro and co-host of the lauded +1 Forward, a podcast powered by the apocalypse</li>
</ul>
<p>This panel will air LIVE on YouTube on Friday, October 25th at 8 PM Eastern.</p>
<p><strong>Gauntlet Community, what questions do YOU have about GMing PbtA games?</strong> Let us know here and I’ll stick them in our planning document.</p>

              <p>The last long-term game I ran was Urban Shadows, which has a built-in timer in the form of Corruption. Games cannot continue with the same character indefinitely. Mine lasted a year before a character sacrificed herself before she could take her last Corruption and become a Threat. My players are not generally fans of partial-success systems, so I wanted to move away from PbtA.</p>
<p>I wanted the ease that comes with a player just describing what they do that would support long-term, character-driven play.</p>
<p>With my long experience with the GM-facing elements of PbtA games and more confidence in general, I was no longer as intimidated by the notion of having to decide on rulings in diceless games.</p>
<p>I began to look into how to run <em>Lords of Gossamer and Shadow</em> without any illusionist baggage or Stuff. I needed structure on <strong>my</strong> end so that I could play to find out what happens. I could use an Agenda, Principles, and Moves, sure - but the diceless approach of avoiding direct, high-risk conflicts in favor of creative problem-solving and fighting smart (and dirty) sounded more like the principles of OSR play I’ve been reading about on the Gauntlet.</p>
<p>Player characters are powerful, but their enemies are, too, and they’ll never “get lucky.”</p>
<p><strong>In a game with attribute-resolved conflicts with no dice, how would you, as a GM, bring modern, honest techniques into the game?</strong></p>
<p>(Kindly avoid the glib “By adding a different resolution system.”)</p>

              <p>So a few friends of mine have been showing some interest in tabletop games. As far as I know, none of them have ever played any sort of tabletop RPG, so I’m wondering how to introduce them to this entirely new hobby, BUT–</p>
<p>We’re all history graduate students at a university, and I thought it could be kinda fun to give them a brief little lecture on the history of RPG’s, the fundamental ideas of what even are RPG’s, etc. whenever we get together, in the style of the kind of lectures we see and give as students and TA’s. If giving/hearing a lecture on the history of anything sounds like the total opposite of fun to you, well, what can I say, that’s how we are =P</p>
<p>It’s really not meant to be anything in depth, just sort of a 10 minute “RPG’s 101” thing to give them some really basic info before we really start with whatever game we play. I’ve been brainstorming what points I’d want to hit, but I was wondering what other people would come up with if they had to give a similar mini-lecture.</p>
<p>I’m really curious because I have to say I’m fairly young/new compared to a lot of folks who have been in the scene a lot longer than I have, and I think there’s a whole world of 80’s/90’s/00’s RPG’s that I’m really only vaguely aware of.</p>
<p>Just really off the top of my head, you’d have like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is a tabletop roleplaying game… super basic concepts, intent, rules/mechanics to simulate X, polyhedral dice, etc.</p>

<li>
<p>Origin: war games, Gary Gygax, D&amp;D (not gonna get into any controversy about if he really invented D&amp;D in this fun lil’ lecture, I’d say…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Layering in the ‘role-playing’ element on top of combat/tactics games, playing a character/telling a story, influenced by genre books, films, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90’s RPG scene offering popular genre alternatives to D&amp;D-- Shadowrun, World of Darkness, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recently: ‘indie’/story games, PbtA, OSR, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What points would you touch on if you were giving like a really broad, completely “Intro to RPG’s”, 101 kind of lecture for some people? Importantly, assume they have <em>some</em> goodwill to listen to you, but you’re probably not going to hold their attention for too long =P</p>

              <p>Our usual group got together last night and, not feeling the heaviness that is our Blades campaign, pulled out my still in shrink copy of The King Is Dead.</p>
<p>This is the $45 copy, so it included everything except a deck of cards. I had been smart, and stashed a standard deck in the box as soon as I got it. Hooray for past me.</p>
<p>This game was <em>wonderful</em>. The intrigue and muster cards put something right in front of us we could use; the lands, units, and troops on the table flavored every interaction and triggered imagination. These bits made it feel like we were overseeing military campaigns, while having no system relevance at all!</p>
<p>Marvelously done. This game has come a long ways from when we first playtested it years ago, and the bits – while initially somewhat confusing – really helped.</p>
